<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Our aim in these pages is to tell a complete
story of the aerial conquest, beginning from crude experiments,
made hundreds of years ago; passing thence
to the first serious experimenters, with their difficulties
and triumphs; and so carrying on the tale to present-day
achievements and the latest-type machines.</p>

<p>There is one aspect of this history which has an
especial fascination; and it is the personality of the
men who&mdash;braving ridicule and scorn and surmounting
obstacles without number&mdash;laid the foundation-stones of
flight. Instead of being a compilation of dates, with
certain explanatory matter added, our book endeavours
to make these men live: to show what induced them
to embark upon their seemingly hopeless quest; to
tell of their dreams and longings, and how they built
their first frail craft; to trace them to their boyhood and
their play with kites; to reveal them, in a word, as
living beings, and not merely as names.</p>

<p>With this strongly human note, emphasizing the
romance of the tale, there goes also a series of explanations&mdash;made
clearer by drawings and diagrams&mdash;and
tending always to show how, link by link and step by
step, data and experience were secured; how each
pioneer, however humble, played his individual and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
useful part; and how in the end, by sifting all such
knowledge and carrying experiment to its final stage,
the Wrights achieved the apparent miracle, and flew
safely and successfully in a power-driven machine.</p>

<p>The book divides itself naturally into sections.
First there is the story of the very early and haphazard tests,
and of the notes and speculations of scientists; then of
the advent of the practical, patient experimenter&mdash;the
man who, taking a hint from the birds, realized that ere
he could hope to fly he must learn first to balance himself
when in the air. This stage, of course, introduces
Otto Lilienthal&mdash;the German engineer who, by his
gliding flights from hilltops with outstretched, bird-like
wings, has won the honour of being styled &#8220;the father
of the aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a narration of his work, so vital a link in
the chain of progress, the story passes to those two
men&mdash;unflurried, reserved, and infinitely painstaking&mdash;who
at last evolved order out of chaos: Wilbur and
Orville Wright. Their diligent study is described;
their perfected glider; the building of their own motor;
and, finally, that great day of triumph which came in
1903&mdash;just eleven years ago.</p>

<p>The world being given thus an aeroplane which
would fly, the steps which followed were mainly those
of perfection and improvement. One by one the limitations
were removed. At first men dared only to fly
above a smooth-surfaced aerodrome, in case their motors
should stop and send them gliding back to earth; but
soon, gaining confidence in themselves and in their
engines, they were passing high across country. So,
also, in regard to their enemy the wind. Dreading even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
a gentle gust at first, for fear it might overturn them,
they have gained so rapidly in skill that, thanks to their
experience and the stability of their machines, the airmen
of to-day will do battle with a gale. In this section of
our book is a description of the greatest feats, both of
early days and of modern times&mdash;such as speed flying,
altitude records, and the touring of continents by air.</p>

<p>Thus logically may the tale be told: with digressions
of course to cover the risks of aviation, and to explain
how they are being overcome; to deal with aerial warfare
and its many problems; to describe the advent
of the sea-plane; and to discuss the day when&mdash;a
perfected passenger craft being available&mdash;men will
journey by air as they do now by land or sea.</p>

from a tower&mdash;The Saracen who &#8220;rose like a bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>In learning to fly, men have passed through five
definite and clearly-marked stages which have extended over centuries,
and cost many lives. These five stages may be summarized thus:</p>

<p>1. Haphazard and foolhardy tests&mdash;ending generally in death.<br /></p>

<p>2. A period of scientific research, in which the flight of birds was
studied and experiments made with lifting planes of various shapes.<br /></p>

<p>3. A phase during which engineers built large, power-driven
machines, but had not the skill to control them when in flight.<br /></p>

<p>4. A stage in which, making a simple apparatus of wings, men
glided from hilltops, and learned to balance themselves while
in the air.<br /></p>

<p>5. The stage in which, perfecting the gliding machines they had
learned to control, men fitted petrol motors to them, and
achieved at last a power-driven flight.</p>

<p>In dim, remote ages, watching winged creatures
as they skimmed above the earth, men longed passionately
to fly; instead of scaling hills or creeping through
woods, they desired to pass high above them; to spurn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the obstructions of creatures earth-bound, and fly over
mountains and seas. This longing to fly, even at the
risk of life itself, was expressed beautifully by Otto
Lilienthal, the greatest of the pioneers. He wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;With each advent of spring, when the
air is alive with innumerable happy creatures; when the storks, on their arrival
at their old northern resorts, fold up the imposing flying apparatus
which carries them thousands of miles, lay back their heads and
announce their arrival by joyfully rattling their beaks; when
the swallows have made their entry and hurry through our streets
and pass our windows in sailing flight; when the lark appears as
a dot in the ether and manifests its joy of existence by its song;
then a certain desire takes possession of man. He longs to
soar upward and to glide free as a bird over smiling fields, leafy
woods, and mirror-like lakes, and so enjoy the fairy landscape as
only a bird can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But man&#8217;s first attempts to fly were ill-judged
and foolish. He failed to understand the problems involved;
he forgot that, even were he able to build a machine which
would navigate the air, he must learn to control this craft;
must learn to steer and balance it, and make it ride the
gusts. One might, for example, take a bicycle and say to
a man: &#8220;Here is a machine that can be propelled along
the road; mount it and ride away.&#8221; But if the man had
not learned to handle a bicycle, and balance himself on
one, he would swerve for a few yards and then fall. So
with the man who, without forethought or study, sought
to navigate the air.</p>

<p>Probing the recesses of history we find that,
even as far back as the reign of the Emperor Nero, there
was one Simon the magician who&mdash;if legend can be
credited&mdash;sought &#8220;to rise towards Heaven.&#8221; Simon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
it would seem, actually lifted himself into the air by
the use of some apparatus; but what this device was
legend does not state. The spectators seem to have
been horrified, and Simon&#8217;s ascent into the air was
attributed to &#8220;the assistance of Beelzebub.&#8221; His
triumph was short-lived, for, as the legend goes on
to record, he fell to the earth and was killed. And
this fate befell many who, in those very early days,
made flimsy wings and threw themselves from towers
or the tops of hills. Simon, it is thought, may have
had some method in his apparent madness. He may,
for instance, have made a lifting plane and discovered
that, if he placed himself in a rising current of air,
the effect would be to raise him from the ground;
and this suggestion has a greater probability when we
remember that in warm, southern lands there are often
strong up-currents of air upon which birds will soar, with
wings motionless. But what machine Simon used, and
how he made his flight&mdash;if he did&mdash;are questions
that remain unanswered.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Looking back into history, one fact is striking;
and this is the part that monks played in studying flight.
They had leisure to think, and time in which to make
tests; and in many a monastery, hundreds of years ago,
quaint theories were propounded and queer craft planned.
In the eleventh century, at Malmesbury in England,
there was a Benedictine monk named Elmerus, or
Oliver, more ambitious than many of his brethren. He
built himself a machine with wings; then, in order
to put it to the test, he ascended a tall tower,
faced the wind, and sprang into the air. That he
had studied weighting and balance to some purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
was evident, for he glided a short distance without
accident; then, struck perhaps by a sudden gust, lost
equilibrium and came crashing to the ground. He
was not killed, as were many less rash than he; but
broke his legs, and nothing more is read of him as an
experimenter. Of the doings of another of these brave
but reckless men&mdash;a Saracen who tried to fly in the
twelfth century&mdash;there is fuller information. He provided
himself with wings which he stiffened with wooden rods,
and held out upon either side of his body. Wearing
these, he mounted to the top of a tower in Constantinople
(<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) and stood waiting for a favourable
gust of wind. When this came and caught his
wings, he &#8220;rose into the air like a bird.&#8221; And then, of
course, seeing that he had no idea of balancing himself
when actually aloft, he fell pell-mell and &#8220;broke
his bones.&#8221; People who had gathered to watch, seeing
this inglorious ending to the flight, burst into laughter:
ridicule rather than praise, indeed, was the fate of the
pioneers, even to the days when the first real flights were made.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century, working upon more
sensible lines of thought, Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;an Italian
genius who was painter, inventor, sculptor, writer, and musician
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
&mdash;devised several machines by which men might navigate
the air. Success did not come to him, as he had no
motive power with which he could equip a craft; but
how keen a watcher he was of the birds is shown by a
passage from one of his manuscripts:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;The kite and other birds, which beat
their wings little, go seeking the course of the wind, and when the wind prevails
on high then will they be seen at a great height, and if it prevails low
they will hold themselves low. When the wind does not prevail
at all, then the kite beats its wings several times in its flight in
such a way that it raises itself high and acquires a start, descending
afterwards a little and progressing without beating its wings,
repeating the same performance time after time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Da Vinci, too, had some notion as to the need for
balancing a machine while in the air, and did not seem&mdash;like
most others of the early pioneers&mdash;to imagine that
once a man had launched himself from a height he
would be able to control his craft by instinct. He wrote,
indeed, suggesting the position of a pilot in a flying
machine, that &#8220;he should be free from the waist upwards,
in order that he might keep himself in equilibrium, as
one does in a boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>He realised, too, a fact that the modern
airman always bears in mind; and that is the value of flying
high. Da Vinci wrote in this regard: &#8220;Safety lies in
flying at a considerable height from the ground, so that
if equilibrium be temporarily upset there may be time
and space for regaining it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the machines Da Vinci planned was
an ornithopter, or craft with arched wings which would
flap like those of a bird; and a helicopter, or apparatus
in which revolving screws are used to draw it up into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the air. He devised mechanism by which a man might
move two wings, shaped like those of the bird, and
thus imitate natural fight. These wings were planned
ingeniously, so that they would contract on the up-stroke
and expand when forced downward. In one of his notebooks,
too, he made a sketch of a helicopter machine
which was to have a lifting propeller 96 feet in diameter,
and to be built of iron with a bamboo framework. He
made paper helicopters, or whirling screws, and sent
them spinning into the air; and to him, also, was due
the first suggestion for the use of a parachute.</p>

<p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Besnier&#8217;s Apparatus.</p>
</div>

<p>From this time, until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, men still strove to fly, but all of them failed to
see a vital point: that they must learn gradually to balance
themselves in the air, even as the young birds have to do.
So those who were not killed were badly injured, and
those who persisted in experiments were looked upon
either as madmen or fools. Some, however, were not
so foolish as they seemed. They brought forward
schemes so as to attract the attention of kings and
those in high places; and this was particularly the case
in France, during the reigns of Louis XIV. and Louis XV.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
But the notoriety they won was short-lived. The day
came when they needed to make good their claims&mdash;when
they were called upon to fly; and then they met
death, disablement, or disgrace, and were forgotten
quickly. Of the devices suggested many showed ingenuity;
and some were quaint, in view of what we
know of flight to-day. In the machine, for instance,
designed by an experimenter named Besnier&mdash;who was
a locksmith by trade&mdash;there were four lifting planes,
closing on the up-stroke and opening on the down, and
these the operator was to flap by the use of his hands
and feet (<a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>). A rather similar idea was suggested
as long ago as 1744, by the inventor De Bacqueville;
his plan was to fix four planes or wings to his hands and
feet, and then propel himself through the air by vigorous
motions of his arms, and kickings of his legs (<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>).
He made a flight from a balcony overlooking a river,
but finished his trial ingloriously by falling into a barge.
Such schemes, indeed, were doomed to failure; and they
are only interesting because they show how, even in
those far-off days, men were ready to risk their lives
in attempts to conquer the air.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /> <small>THE WORK OF SCIENTISTS</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Sir George Cayley&#8217;s forecasts&mdash;A
steam-driven model which flew&mdash;The shape and curve of planes.</p>

<p>So passed the haphazard stage of flight; and
now history moves to a second and more important period, that in
which men of science were attracted to the problem.
They worked upon theories, and made experiments with
models; they studied the shape which Nature has given
the birds; they sifted false notions and showed where
error lay. But they did not fly. They were merely
clearers of the ground, gathering information and classifying
it, and paving the way for those daring workers who
were to follow them&mdash;men who, by putting science to
the test, were willing to risk their lives.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Sir George Cayley&#8217;s<br />
suggestion for an<br />Arched Plane.</p>
</div>

<p>To England goes the distinction of the first
practical attempts to solve the problems of flight; and it is
the work of Sir George Cayley, an eminent scientist and
engineer, that next merits attention. In a series of
articles, published in <i>Nicholson&#8217;s Journal</i> during the
years 1809-10, he forecasted many of the principles that
go to the making of a modern-type aeroplane. He
advised the construction of machines with fixed, outstretched
wings like those of a bird; but he did more
than this, for it is admitted generally he was first to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
point out that, to increase their lifting power as they
were moved through the air, these wings should not be
flat, but should be curved from front to back, or arched
upward (<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>). How important this suggestion was,
subsequent experimenters were to show. Sir George
Cayley realised also that a tail-plane, carried at the
rear of a machine, would give it equilibrium, and might
be moved up and down to control ascent or descent;
and he used a rudder upon models, to steer them from
side to side. He advised the use of steam engines as a
motive power, and of revolving propellers to drive a craft
through the air. But, like many another man, he was
before his time. He built experimental craft&mdash;one, a
model glider, which would sail down gracefully from
the top of a hill; and another, a far larger machine, which would
bear a man through the air, for a distance of several yards, if he
ran forward with it against the wind. But the difficulty
of obtaining a sufficiently light and practical motor, either
of steam or other power, was an obstacle that proved
insurmountable. One light engine, which Sir George
Cayley planned, was to be driven by a series of gunpowder
explosions in a cylinder; but the suggestion
came to no practical issue.</p>

<p>This scientist did not write or work in vain.
He compiled data which was invaluable, and interested and
encouraged other men&mdash;even those, indeed, who in due
course made the conquest. One of the first to work
upon Sir George Cayley&#8217;s theories was an experimenter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
named Henson. He planned an ambitious machine
weighing about a ton. It was to have planes of canvas
stretched over a rigidly trussed frame of bamboo rods
and hollow wooden spars; and these planes were to
contain 4500 square feet of lifting surface, and be driven
by screws operated by a steam engine of 30 h.p. (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>But this craft did not take practical shape, although
in its appearance and many of its details it bore a
resemblance to machines which ultimately were to fly.
In the specification of the patent he took out for his
invention, Henson indicated that it was for</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;Improvements in locomotive
apparatus and machinery for conveying letters, goods, and passengers
from place to place through the air.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <img src="images/figure05.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="247" />
<p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Henson&#8217;s proposed Machine.</p>
</div>

<p>Explaining his theories in this same specification he wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;If any light and flat or nearly flat article
be projected or thrown edgewise in a slightly inclined position, the same will
rise into the air till the force exerted is expended, when the
article so thrown or projected will descend; and it will readily
be conceived that, if the article so projected or thrown possessed
in itself a continuous power or force equal to that used in
throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to ascend so long
as the forward part of the surface was upwards in respect to the hinder part.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Had Henson been able to carry out his ideas,
it is almost certain that this experimental machine would
have been wrecked in its tests, and probably several
more after it, seeing that he would have had to learn to
control them when in flight, and remembering also that,
even with aircraft as they are built to-day, many details
have to be studied and improved before a successful
model is evolved.</p>

<p>All such work, of course, entails heavy expense.
It was, indeed, the cost of experiments which prevented
many an early inventor from building a full-sized
machine. The designing and construction of a man-carrying
craft, and the employment of skilled workmen
and mechanics, to say nothing of repairs that may have
to be made during a series of tests, represent an expenditure
that may amount to thousands of pounds. As
a rule, the inventor is not a man of wealth; and so far
as flying was concerned, at any rate in the early days,&mdash;and
to a more limited extent even at the present time,&mdash;people
with money thought the difficulties so great
that they would not advance funds for the carrying out
of trials. So men with ideas had to do the best they
could, and this resolved itself generally into writing and
lecturing, and endeavouring to interest the public. But
the public was not easily interested; ordinary folk did
not believe that men would ever fly, while many people
declared that it was going against Nature for us to try to
imitate the birds, and that nothing but mischief would
come of so doing.</p>

<p>Henson, failing to make definite progress with
his scheme for a man-carrying craft&mdash;despite the fact that a
company was floated to assist him&mdash;co-operated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
another enthusiast named Stringfellow in a plan which
was not so elaborate. They began to experiment with a
series of models driven by tiny and most ingenious
steam engines built by Stringfellow; and so cleverly did
he construct them that the Aeronautical Society awarded
him a prize of £100. The model which won him this
recognition was a little plant which, while it weighed
only 13 lbs., without water or fuel, would develop one horse-power.</p>

<p>What, by the way, is meant by a horse-power?
The answer is as follows: in the early days of engineering,
when it was found necessary to establish some well-recognised
unit of power, a large number of experiments
were carried out with horses, which were made to raise a
weight from the ground by means of an arrangement of
pulleys and ropes. The experiments showed this: that
a horse can exert sufficient power to raise 33,000 lbs., or
about 15 tons, to a height of 1 foot in the space of one
minute. This, therefore, was called &#8220;one horse-power.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Stringfellow&#8217;s days, it must be remembered,
there was no petrol engine; an engine so extremely light for
the power that it will give, and with its liquid fuel and
oil carried conveniently in tanks&mdash;an engine which, as
Sir Hiram Maxim puts it, will give one horse-power of
energy &#8220;for the weight of a barn-door fowl.&#8221;</p>

<p>The question of motive-power was, indeed,
the great obstacle for the pioneers. When a man builds an
aeroplane he must drive it through the air; and to drive
it through the air he requires an engine. But he knows
that his planes, owing to the small density or sustaining
power of the air through which they pass, will raise only
a limited load. And the machine itself, even if it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
built of wood and canvas, represents an appreciable
weight; to say nothing of that of the pilot. So, if his
engine is heavy in proportion to the power it gives, and
its fuel weighty, he may be prevented altogether from
rising from the ground; or if he does rise, he may be
able only to carry sufficient fuel for a flight of a short distance.</p>

<p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Henson
and Stringfellow&#8217;s Model.</p>
</div>

<p>Henson and Stringfellow built in 1845 a model
which weighed about 30 lbs. (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>); and although its stability
was not perfect, it was an interesting machine&mdash;a forecast
of the monoplane of the future. Here one saw the lifting
planes take shape; the body between the wings; the
tail-planes at the rear; and, above all, a suggestion of
the means by which machines would be driven through
the air: the fitting to the model, that is to say, of
revolving propellers or screws. When an inventor has
fitted an engine to an aircraft, means must be devised
for using its power to drive the machine through the
air; and to make the wings flap like those of a bird,
has been found so complicated, owing to the mechanism
necessary to imitate natural movements, that much of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the power is wasted. Inventors such as Henson and
Stringfellow, realising this difficulty, made wings that were
outstretched and immovable, like those of a bird when
it is soaring, and relied upon screw propellers&mdash;which
they set spinning at great speed by means of their
engines&mdash;to thrust their craft forward through the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_7" id="Fig_7"></a>
  <img src="images/figure07.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="276" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p>
</div>

<p>In an early and simple form, the aerial propeller
was as shown in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>. Here are two curved blades, so
shaped that, when the propeller is made to revolve quickly, these blades
will act powerfully upon the air. What the propeller
does is to screw itself forward through the air,
as one might revolve a corkscrew and drive it
into a cork, or force a gimlet into a piece of
wood. Each time you twist the gimlet for instance,
as you drive it inwards, it forces itself a certain distance
through the wood; and in a like manner the air-propeller, each
time it revolves, tends to bore its way through the
air (<a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>) and so push, or draw with it, the flying
machine to which it is attached. But with air, seeing
that its density is small, it is necessary to use a
large screw, and to turn it fast, before power can be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
In 1845, Stringfellow, who was now working
alone&mdash;Henson having abandoned the tests and gone
abroad&mdash;met with a definite success. He obtained actual
flights with a steam-driven model in the form of a
monoplane, weighing 8&frac12; lbs. These tests attracted
attention among scientists, but they led to nothing
else&mdash;that is to say, no full-sized machine was the
result. But Stringfellow&#8217;s model interested many people
in the problems of flight. It showed, indeed, although
in miniature, that a flying machine could be built and
driven through the air; and so this patient experimenter
did not labour in vain.</p>

<p>Following Stringfellow, upon the list of
those who forged links in the aerial conquest, came Francis
Herbert Wenham. His interest in flying, as with
many other men, was aroused by watching the birds.
Wenham, an engineer by profession, made a voyage
up the Nile; and his study of the movement of birds,
as they flew near his yacht, caused him to take
up aviation in earnest, and carry out experiments for
the Aeronautical Society. Wenham was interested
largely in the lifting power of planes, and sought
efficient shapes. He recommended the building of
arched surfaces, so arranged that they had considerable
span, but were narrow from front to back; and he
suggested also that they should, when fitted to a
machine, be placed one above another. Thus Wenham
was the inventor of the biplane, as we know that craft to-day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>In explaining this point he wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;Having remarked how thin a stratum of air
is displaced between the wings of a bird in rapid flight, it follows that, in
order to obtain the necessary length of plane for supporting
heavy weights, the surfaces may be superposed, or placed in
parallel rows with an interval between them&#8221; (<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft">
  <a name="Fig_9" id="Fig_9"></a>
  <img src="images/figure09.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="88" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Superposed Lifting Planes.</p>
</div>

<p>To illustrate his theory, he built a model which
had six long, narrow planes, arranged one above the other,
rather like the slats of a Venetian blind. Wenham&#8217;s
experiments were highly important, because they cleared
a great deal of ground, and removed many misunderstandings.
By showing that a long, narrow plane was
more efficient&mdash;would, that is to say, carry a greater
load through the air than one which was deep from
front to back, owing to the fact that it is the
front section of an inclined plane that provides the most
&#8220;lift&#8221;; and by illustrating how, in a full-sized machine,
such a row of planes could be arranged one above another,
Wenham directed men&#8217;s thoughts towards a definite
goal. By his work, and chiefly by his sifting of data,
an outline was obtained of that aeroplane of the future
which was actually to fly.</p>

<p>While Wenham was experimenting, an inventor
named Penaud, in France, testing a series of models,
made one which was driven by the twisting of elastic,
and flew quite well. Penaud&#8217;s work in this respect is
interesting, because small elastic-driven machines, such
as he designed, were used afterwards in demonstration,
and are flown to-day. For a miniature aeroplane,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
elastic is an ideal motive force&mdash;light and yet providing
ample power, and with only one disadvantage:
it unwinds itself rapidly, and then the model must descend.</p>

<p>In experiments of permanent value, after
the discoveries of Wenham, important work was that of
Horatio Phillips. Like Wenham, he devoted his attention
mainly to a study of lifting planes, and tested
many shapes and curves. Sir George Cayley, it may
be remembered, had suggested a curved and not a flat
plane; but Phillips went one better than this, for in 1881
he devised a plane with what has been termed a dipping front edge.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;The Phillips Wing-Curve.</p>
</div>

<p>The shape and curve of a plane, is of vital importance.
A machine may be built, and an engine and propellers fitted, but the question
is: Will the planes support through the air the load they have been
given to carry? Phillips made many experiments, and
in the end he produced a wing-shape which he patented.
He pointed out that an advantage might be gained in lifting
effect if the main curve or camber was situated near
the front edge of the plane, and not in the centre (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).
The theory Phillips worked upon was this&mdash;and it is interesting
if it can be expressed clearly. Taking a plane
curved as he recommended, with this &#8220;hump&#8221; towards
the front, and forcing it through the air as would be the
case were an aeroplane in flight, the rush of wind which
meets the edge of the plane is split into two currents&mdash;one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
sweeping above and one below. The air current
below the plane, following its curve, is thrust downward,
and in being so thrust down imparts a lift to the plane;
while the current thrown above the plane&mdash;rushing up
and over the &#8220;hump&#8221; which, as has been shown, is situated
close to the front edge&mdash;will sweep rearwards in such a
way that there is a partial vacuum or air space between
the fast-moving wind current and the curved-down
section of the plane behind the &#8220;hump.&#8221; The value of
such a vacuum is this: it has a raising effect upon
the surface of the plane, which is thus not only
pushed up from below, but drawn from above.</p>

<div class="figleft">
  <a name="Fig_11" id="Fig_11"></a>
  <img src="images/figure11.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="193" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Suction above a Cambered Surface.</p>
</div>

<p>How a vacuum is caused, by air passing over such an
arched surface as Phillips recommended, may be shown in a simple experiment.
Take a sheet of paper and curve it in the way shown
in <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, allowing the rear portion to hinge in such
a way that it will move freely up and down. Then, if the
sheet of paper is held between the finger and thumb
and one blows across the top edge, the hinged flap at the
rear will be found to raise itself&mdash;drawn up by the
influence of the vacuum, such as Phillips describes.</p>

<p>Apart from his theory as to the dipping front
edge of a plane, Phillips agreed with a suggestion made by
Wenham; and this was that a plane, in order to be
most effective in its &#8220;lift,&#8221; should be narrow from front
to back. This theory meant that, as a plane moved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
forward, it was the curving front section which gripped
and acted up the air; and that, if the plane was carried
too far towards the rear, its lifting influence fell away,
while the surface that was superfluous acted as so much
resistance to the machine&#8217;s progress through the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Phillips&#8217;s
Experimental Craft.</p>
</div>

<p>In furtherance of his views, Phillips built the
strange-looking machine which is seen in <a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>.
It resembled, more than anything else, a huge Venetian blind; and he
adopted this form so as to introduce as many narrow
planes as possible. There were, as a matter of fact, fifty
in the machine, each 22 feet long and only 1&frac12; inch wide.
The craft, as can be seen, was mounted on a light
carriage which, having wheels fitted to it, ran round and
round upon a railed track. A steam engine was used as
motive power, driving a two-bladed propeller at the rate
of 400 revolutions a minute. The machine was so
arranged on its metals that, although the rear wheels
could raise themselves and show whether the planes
exercised a lift, the front one was fixed to its track&mdash;thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
preventing the apparatus from leaping into the air, overturning,
and perhaps wrecking itself. Tests with the
machine were successful. The lifting influence of the
planes, when the engine drove them forward, was
sufficient to raise the rear wheels from the track; and
they did so even when a weight of 72 lbs., in addition to
that of the apparatus, had been placed upon the carriage.
In his main object, then, Phillips succeeded; and that
was to show the lifting power of his planes. But his
apparatus had not the makings of a practical aeroplane.
He gained for himself, nevertheless, a name that has
lived and will live. Even to-day, in discussing the wing-shape
of some machine, draughtsmen will speak of the
&#8220;Phillips entry.&#8221; Other workers did not pin themselves
exactly to his shapes or theories, but these paved the
way for a series of further tests.</p>

<p>Science was forging link by link indeed
the chain that would lead to an ultimate conquest. Sir George
Cayley suggested an arched plane; Wenham devised
a machine in which narrow planes should be fitted one
above another; and Phillips laid down the rule for a
curve or camber of special shape, which should exercise
most &#8220;lift&#8221; when thrust through the air. But still
men lacked many things; all the links in the chain
were far from being in their place; and one of the
greatest flaws was that no man, even supposing he was
able to build a machine that would fly, had learned
as yet to balance that machine when it was in the air.

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /> <small>FIRST FRUITS OF STUDY</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">The building of large machines&mdash;Sir Hiram
Maxim&#8217;s costly work&mdash;A steam-driven French craft which flew&mdash;Professor
Langley&#8217;s research in America.</p>

<p>Of the way research next tended, it may be said that
it was the first putting into practice of the theories science
had laid down; for now, having an idea as to the shape
of planes, and knowing that these planes could be made to
carry a load through the air, there were engineers who
began to build man-carrying, power-driven machines.
In so doing, however, they may be said to have tried to
run before they could walk. What they did was to provide
the world with powerful flying craft before there
were men who could handle them.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting and ambitious
designs was that of Sir Hiram Maxim; and it was one to which
he devoted years of labour and large sums of money.
He is said, indeed, to have expended £20,000 upon
aerial research. After a number of experiments with
plane shapes, following the theories of Phillips, he began
to build a very large machine, which he set upon a
miniature railway as Phillips had done, using the same
precaution of a check-rail to prevent it from rising more
than a certain distance in the air. His apparatus, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
built at Baldwin&#8217;s Park, Kent, weighed 8000 lbs.: it
was, in fact, the largest machine ever built. The span
of its planes was 105 feet, and they offered a total
supporting surface of 6000 square feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="center space-below2">A. Elevating Plane; B.B. Outriggers; C.C. Operating
Wires;<br />D.D. Position for ascending; E.E. Position for descending.</p>
</div>

<p>The inventor employed the suggestion made
by Wenham, and fitted his lifting planes one above the
other; while he used a horizontal plane in front of the
machine to act as an elevator. This plane could be
tilted up and down; and the idea was that, when it was
tilted upward as the machine ran forward upon its rails,
it would exercise such a lifting influence that the front of
the craft itself would be raised, and so cause the main-planes
to assume a steeper angle to the air; and the
result of the planes being inclined thus more steeply
would be to give them a greater lift, and so induce the
whole machine to raise itself from the ground. This
system is explained in <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>, and is important because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
such lifting planes, for rising or descending, have now
come into general use.</p>

<p>Sir Hiram Maxim employed another controlling
surface which has become a feature of present-day aircraft, and
this was an upright plane, which could be swung from
side to side, and by which his craft was to be steered.
Such a rudder-plane is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>.
By this means, as will be shown later, practically all aeroplanes
are steered to-day. The action of the aerial rudder,
when it is moved from side to side, is like that of swinging the
rudder of a ship; but for the same reason that propellers have
to be made large&mdash;owing to the small density of the air&mdash;so
an aeroplane rudder needs to be a comparatively
large plane, in proportion to the size of the craft, before
it will exercise an adequate turning influence.</p>

</div>

<p>To drive his machine Sir Hiram used two
specially-built and lightened steam engines, which developed a
total of 360 h.p., and yet weighed only 640 lbs.; that
is to say, they gave one h.p. of energy for each 1&frac34; lb.
of weight. But they were only suitable for purposes of
experiment. Sir Hiram himself wrote:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;The quantity of water consumed was so large
that the machine could only remain in the air for a few minutes, even if
I had had room to man&#339;uvre and learn the knack of balancing
it in the air. It was only too evident to me that it was no use
to go on with the steam engine.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engines drove two canvas-covered wooden
screws, each 18 feet in length, and the general appearance
of the machine is indicated by <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a>. In these
trials, although it was always captive, the aeroplane
demonstrated much that its inventor had set himself to
prove. In Sir Hiram Maxim&#8217;s own words, it showed
that it had &#8220;a lifting effect of more than a ton, in
addition to the weight of three men and 600 lbs. of
water.&#8221; He adds: &#8220;My machine demonstrated one
very important fact, and that was that very large
aeroplanes had a fair degree of lifting power for their area.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
So unmistakably did this craft show its lifting power,
that&mdash;in one fierce effort to rise&mdash;it broke a check rail
which kept it upon its metals, with the consequence that
it became unmanageable, swerved sideways, and was
wrecked. At this stage Sir Hiram, having no faith in
the future of such steam engines as he was using, and
having spent a large sum of money, was compelled to
relinquish his tests. His trouble was that he was,
as the saying goes, &#8220;before his time.&#8221; The machine
was too ambitious and too large. That it would have
lifted itself into the air was proved; but there was no
man living who could have controlled it. To put in
charge of such a craft a man who knew nothing of the
navigation of the air, would have been like placing a
novice at the levers of a 60-mile-an-hour express.
Picture such a huge aircraft in the hands of a man
who had never flown. It would rise, it is true; but
how could one who was not an expert so adjust the
angle of its lifting plane that it would glide smoothly
from the ground and not rear itself upward and fall with
a crash? A machine is struck by wind-gusts, too, when
it is aloft; and there is the delicate art of making a
descent, without damaging one&#8217;s craft by a rough
contact with the ground. Besides, it would have been
unlikely that this machine, being purely experimental,
would have been perfectly balanced as it flew: it
might have shown a tendency to slip sideways when in
the air, or dive steeply. All of which goes to show
this: that the inventor might have wrecked one costly
machine after another before he obtained a practical
model, even were he lucky enough to escape with his
life. Sir Hiram Maxim&#8217;s machine, while it settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
problems as to weight-lifting and power, lacked the
man who could fly it; and so did others of these man-lifting
craft which were built before their time. A child
must learn to walk before it can run, and must learn to
crawl before it can walk. And what had not been realised,
at this stage of the conquest, was that there must be
some stage between building a model and a full-sized,
motor-driven machine: some step, in a word, by which
a man might learn, without too great a risk of death,
to balance himself when in the air.</p>

<p>While Sir Hiram Maxim in England was devoting
time and money to the quest, there was another skilled
engineer, a Frenchman, who was working at the
problem, and also by means of large machines. This
was Clement Ader, one of the European pioneers of
the telephone, and he experimented for many years.
One of his first machines had wings like those of a
bird, and these the would-be flier was to operate by
his own muscular power. But this failed, seeing that
men are not provided with sufficient power, by their
unaided efforts, to wing their way through the air in a
flapping flight. As Giovanni Borelli, a seventeenth
century writer, quaintly puts it: &#8220;It is impossible that
men should be able to fly craftily by their own strength.&#8221;</p>

  <p class="center">PLATE I.&mdash;THE LANGLEY MACHINE.</p>
  <p class=" blockquot space-below1">This craft, a double monoplane, was
launched from a platform over the river Potomac, loaded with a weight equivalent
to that of a man. The trials were unsuccessful; but recently&mdash;after a
lapse of many years&mdash;the Langley machine has been tested again,
and has proved its ability to fly.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Ader next turned to steam-driven craft, and
built a series of queer, bat-like machines, which he called
&#8220;Avions,&#8221; one of which is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>.
Its wings were built up lightly and with great strength
by means of hollow wooden spars, and had a span of
54 feet, being deeply arched. The whole machine
weighed 1100 lbs., and was thus far smaller and
lighter than Maxim&#8217;s mighty craft. To propel it,
Ader used a couple of horizontal, compound steam
engines, which gave 20 h.p. each and drew the
machine through the air by means of two 4-bladed
screws. The craft was controlled by altering the
inclination of its wings, and also by a rudder, the
pilot sitting in a carriage below the planes. In 1890,
after its inventor had spent a large sum of money, the
machine&mdash;which, unlike those of Phillips and Maxim,
ran upon wheels and was free to rise&mdash;did actually
make a flight, or rather a leap into the air, covering
a distance of about fifty yards. But then, on coming
into contact with the ground again, it was wrecked.
Ader&#8217;s experiments were regarded by the French
Government as being so important that he received
a grant equalling £20,000 to assist him in continuing
his tests; and this goes to show how, even from
the first, the French nation was&mdash;by reason of its
enthusiasm and imagination&mdash;able to appreciate what its
inventors were striving to attain, and eager to encourage
them in their quest. For just an opposite reason&mdash;because,
that is to say, it had not this imagination
nor intuition&mdash;England neglected her experimenters, or
merely regarded their efforts with an amused tolerance,
as though they were children playing with toys.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Ader&#8217;s greatest success came in 1897.
With an improved machine, he obtained a flight through the
air of nearly 300 yards; and this goes down to
history as being the first ascent by a power-driven
aeroplane having a man on board. Ader&#8217;s name
will never be forgotten, and one of his machines is
exhibited, as a relic beyond price, at the Institute
of Arts and Science in Paris. But the flight ended
in damage to the machine, as the other had done.
A wind gust threatened to overturn the craft, its engines
were shut off, and it descended so heavily that it was
wrecked. Through constant difficulties in regard to
motive power, and the heavy cost of his experimental
work, Ader was unable to make a definite success, or
produce a machine which could be called a practical
craft. In his case again, as in that of Maxim, there
was a great and apparently insurmountable defect.
The aeroplane would rise; its engines and propellers
would drive it through the air; but the steersman
had not his machine under control: he had not,
in a word, learned to fly. The prospect, therefore,
was unpromising, because one machine after another
might share the same fate&mdash;rising into the air, flying
a hundred yards or so, and then over-balancing and
crashing to earth: thus, in fact, might thousands of
pounds be squandered.</p>

<p>But this stage of putting into practice
what science had taught, although disheartening for those
who passed through it, was still of value; it made
a stepping-stone to the next. One of the men who
thus laboured, without himself seeing his work brought
to the goal of success, was Professor S. P. Langley,
an American scientist connected with the Smithsonian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Institution, and a man of original ideas and great
resource. He made a methodical investigation of
the action of lifting planes and the shape of propellers,
using a large revolving table so that he
could test the latter while they were moving through
the air. Then he began building models which took
a double monoplane form, as indicated by <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>,
with wings set at dihedral or upturned angle. This
uptilting of the wings was to give the models stability
while in flight: and the fixing of planes at the dihedral
angle was tested, by later experimenters, in regard to
full-sized machines. But while it gave an undoubted
stability when a craft was flying under fair conditions, it
was declared by some experts to be a disadvantage in
gusty winds. There seemed also a risk that a machine
so built might slip sideways when upon a turn. But in
some machines to-day a modified dihedral angle is used,
and with satisfactory results.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Langley&#8217;s
Steam-driven Model.</p>
</div>

<p>Professor Langley&#8217;s models, tested over the
river Potomac, flew many times for distances of half a mile.
One, weighing 25 lbs., flew for appreciably more than
half a mile, and at a speed of 20 miles an hour;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and with another, which was slightly larger and
weighed 30 lbs., a three-quarters of a mile flight was
obtained. This model measured a little more than
12 feet across its wing tips, and was about 16 feet
long. The miniature steam engine which drove it,
developing 1&frac12; h.p., weighed about 7 lbs., and operated
a couple of two-bladed propellers which were fitted
behind the main wings, and turned in opposite directions
at the rate of 1200 revolutions a minute.</p>

<p>So successful were Professor Langley&#8217;s models
that the United States War Department became interested;
and the result was that an official grant was made
for the building, according to the Professor&#8217;s plans, of
a machine of man-carrying size. But with this craft,
which weighed 830 lbs., and was driven by a 52 h.p.
engine&mdash;and is shown in <a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>&mdash;there
was a record of failure: launched from the roof of a house-boat over
the Potomac, it fell several times into the water; and
ultimately, and largely owing to the heavy cost of tests
with such large machines, the trials had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>But that the Langley machine would have flown,
had it been launched more carefully, has been demonstrated
recently, and in a remarkable way. On June 28th, 1914,
obtaining permission to make tests with the actual
Langley machine, which had been preserved as a relic.
Mr. Glenn Curtiss fitted the craft with floats, and drove
it across the surface of the water at Hammondsport,
New York, using the same engine that had been in the
machine during its early and unsuccessful trials. After
skimming the water for a short distance the monoplane
rose, flying steadily and well, and vindicating its constructor&#8217;s
theories, although he himself was dead.

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /> <small>OTTO AND GUSTAV LILIENTHAL</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">How two German schoolboys built wings which they tested
on moonlit nights&mdash;The beginnings of a great and patient quest&mdash;Otto Lilienthal&#8217;s
theories and study of the birds.</p>

<p>Much of the ground has now been cleared,
and&mdash;apart from such a story as may be told merely from
facts and figures, and is apt to prove unsatisfying&mdash;we
have striven to show the inner meaning of this great quest:
how each of these pioneers, although he may have
seemed to spend money in vain, and build models only
to meet with failure, was really playing a useful part;
was in fact&mdash;although he himself did not realise
it&mdash;forging one of the links in the chain.</p>

<p>It has been shown how men passed from
an ill-judged, haphazard stage; how science threw upon
the problem the clear, cold light of wisdom; and then,
further encouraged by the data that was to hand, how
there were engineers who were ready to build large
machines and demonstrate that, even in a crude and
early form, an apparatus with curved planes would
lift itself from the ground.</p>

<p>But still there remained this problem: how were
men to learn to balance themselves when in the air?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
And, in considering the equilibrium of the aeroplane,
it must be remembered that the air in which a
machine must fly is a disturbed and turbulent sea.
So, even were a man to build himself a craft which
would, without the need of a hand upon its levers,
balance itself accurately when in still air, there would
still be the problem of the wind gusts; there would, that
is to say, still be the risk of a machine being struck by
an air-wave, particularly when flying near the ground,
and being thrown out of its balance and dashed to earth.</p>

<p>As waves roll across the surface of the sea,
so in the aerial ocean are there breakers and eddies and
many dangers unknown; and men cannot see, but
only feel them. The air does not flow in regular
streams over the earth&#8217;s surface; could we follow its
movements with our eyes, we should see that it is full
of whirls and eddies, with currents of warm air flowing
upward, streams of cool air moving downward; and
with all the obstructions on the face of the earth, such
as hills and woods, causing an interruption and a disturbance
in the air flowing over them (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a>). The
face of a cliff, for instance, will deflect a current upward,
leaving a partial void at its summit; and into this void
the air will rush in the form of a whirling eddy.

<p>The man who would learn to fly has to launch
himself into a treacherous, quickly-moving element; and
one which, to add to his perils, he cannot see. The
rower in a boat, who sets out upon a stormy sea, can
watch the flow of the waves and turn the prow of his
vessel to a breaker that threatens him. But the aerial
navigator moves in a medium that is invisible; gusts
that rush upon him are unseen; he is unaware of their
onslaught until his craft heels before the shock. This
risk, from the sudden sweeping up of an air-wave, was
put clearly by Wilbur Wright when he wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">&#8220;A gust, coming on very suddenly,
will strike the front of a machine and will throw it up before the back
part is acted on at all. Or the right wing may encounter a wind of very
different velocity and trend to the left wing.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the aerial sea a machine will pitch and
roll as does a ship upon the water; and the man who would
fly must learn to check his craft, should it threaten to
overturn; must be ready instantly with some system of
controlling gear so as to correct the influence of each
driving gust. And his task is made the harder because
his machine, when struck suddenly by a gust, may fall
towards the earth at any angle. On the road, when one
learns to ride a bicycle, the machine will topple to one
side or the other; but a craft in the air may fall forward
or backward as well as from side to side, or partly
forward and partly backward&mdash;or may slip and dive at
any possible angle, either forward or backward or upon
either side. A pioneer wrote, after his first experience
in learning to fly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">&#8220;It is rather like trying to steer a motor-car
along an exceptionally greasy road; you seem to slip all ways at once;
and to slip so quickly also that, unless you make the right
balancing movements without an instant&#8217;s delay, you find your
machine has gone beyond control.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he were to succeed, if he were to fly like
a bird, then a man had to learn this art of balancing himself in
the air. Futile it was, as has been shown, to build some
powerfully-engined machine that no one could control;
futile also, and perilous as well, to make a pair of wings
and jump from a tower. Another way must be found,
or the quest abandoned and admitted hopeless. Here
was the need; and here too, as we shall tell, came the
man; a man who was not famous, who worked without
reward and struggled to find time for his experiments;
who died before he could see the final triumph; yet
who won a fame that cannot die, and whom men call
&#8220;the father of the aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Germany one turns in telling the story
of this man&#8217;s work. He was an engineer, Otto Lilienthal by
name, and from the days of his boyhood he and his
brother Gustav, living in Anklam, a small German
town, were builders of model aeroplanes and students of
the flight of birds. When the boys were thirteen and
fourteen years of age respectively, they designed a flying
machine; and in describing it afterwards, Gustav Lilienthal
wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;Our wings consisted of beech veneer with straps on the
under sides through which we pushed our arms. It was our
intention to run down a hill and to rise against the wind like a
stork. In order to escape the gibes of our schoolmates, we
experimented at night-time on the drill-ground outside the
town; but there being no wind on these clear, star-lit summer
nights, we met with no success.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>But they were not discouraged, and continued to
build simple, easily-constructed machines&mdash;from each of
which, although it would not fly, they learned a useful
lesson. One, for instance, they made with wings of
goose feathers, sewn upon tape and fixed to wooden
spars. These wings, when finished, they fastened upon
hoops which were strapped to the operator&#8217;s chest and
hips; and he could, by means of a lever and a stirrup
arrangement, beat the wings up and down by movements
of his legs. This machine they hung from a beam in an
attic in their house; but although the wings <i>did</i> flap,
and actually showed some tendency to lift, the apparatus
was soon consigned to a lumber-room, and they were
busy with plans for another.</p>

<p>What impressed Otto Lilienthal was the fact
that, even when provided by Nature with a perfect flying
apparatus, the birds of the air had to learn to use it.
They could not just leap upward and &#8220;ride the wind&#8221; as
men had tried to do; they needed to take their first
fluttering flights&mdash;beating their wings anxiously and
often falling back to earth, because they did not know as
yet how to use these wings. Particularly did Lilienthal
study the flight of storks. He obtained young birds from
neighbouring villages, and fed them in his garden with
meat and fish while he watched their efforts to learn to
fly, and studied that marvellous piece of mechanism&mdash;the
wing Nature had given them. Writing of his observations
in a book he afterwards prepared, called <i>Birdflight
as the Basis of Aviation</i>, Lilienthal describes the antics
of young storks upon the lawn behind his house:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">
&#8220;When the actual flying practice begins, the first attention
is devoted to the determination of the wind direction; all the
exercises are practised against the wind, but since the latter is
not so constant on the lawn as on the roofs, progress is some-what
slower. Frequently a sudden squall produces eddies in
the air, and it is most amusing to watch the birds dancing about
with lifted wings in order to catch the wind which changes from
one side to another, all round. Any successful short flight is
announced by joyful manifestations. When the wind blows
uniformly from an open direction over the clearing, the young
stork meets it, hopping and running; then turning round, he
gravely walks back to the starting-point and again tries to rise
against the wind.</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;Such exercises are continued daily: at first only one single
wing-beat succeeds, and before the wings can be raised for the
second beat, the long, cautiously placed legs are again touching
ground. But as soon as this stage is passed, <i>i.e.</i> when a second
wing-beat is possible without the legs touching the ground,
progress becomes very rapid, because the increased forward
velocity facilitates flight, and three, four, or more double beats
follow each other in one attempt, maybe awkward and unskilled,
but never attended by accident, because of the caution exercised
by the bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lilienthal was fascinated by the mechanism
of the bird&#8217;s wing. He and his brother built one machine
after another to determine the exact amount of lifting
effort that a man could obtain by imitating the wing-beat
of a bird. One such apparatus is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>. This had a double set of wings; a wide pair
in the centre and narrower ones in front and at the rear.
These wings beat alternately, by movements of the
operator&#8217;s legs; and the machine was suspended by a
rope and pulleys from a beam, being counterbalanced
by a weight. The tests showed this: that, after some
practice in working the wings, a man could raise with
them just half the weight of himself and of the machine;
but the muscular effort proved so great that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
only maintain this rate of wing-beating for a few seconds.
Here, incidentally, a fact may be mentioned: the energy
a man can produce, at all events for a prolonged effort,
has been estimated at about a quarter of a horse-power;
and this&mdash;in tests so far made&mdash;has been insufficient for
the purpose of wing-flapping flight. Lilienthal himself
thought that, with some perfect form of apparatus, a
man might fly with an expenditure of 1·5 h.p. of energy;
but other experimenters have put the minimum power
necessary, even if mechanism could be devised, at 2 h.p.
And another fact must be remembered: even had Lilienthal
been able, with such a machine, actually to raise himself
in the air, he would still have had the problem of
balancing himself, in addition to the working of his wings.</p>

</div>

<p>After many tests such as these, carried out
over a number of years, during which the brothers grew from
boys to men, Lilienthal decided that no good results
could be obtained unless a machine was made to move
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
forward through the air, instead of seeking to rise
straight upward. By such forward motion if rapidly
made, and with a suitably shaped wing or surface, he
calculated that a definite support might be obtained
from the air, and without any great output of energy.
The value of forward motion is seen when a large bird
seeks to rise. The first few flaps are heavy and laboured;
but after this, as soon as it begins to travel forward, the
wings exercise a lifting influence apart from their beat;
and, as the bird flies faster, so its wing-beats become
less violent. An instance of the need for a bird to move
forward when it begins to fly, is provided in the case, say, of
a sparrow imprisoned in a chimney: even if the chimney
is wide, and there is plenty of room for the bird to fly straight
upward and escape, it has not the power to lift itself vertically
for any appreciable distance, because it cannot obtain the lifting
assistance of a leap forward through the air; it is in fact
a prisoner within the chimney.</p>

<p>Lilienthal studied the gliding or soaring flight
of many birds; that form of flight in which, with its wings
outstretched and held almost motionless, a bird such as
the falcon will hover in the air, using no apparent effort
and yet supporting itself with ease; diving, rising again,
and wheeling in a perfect mastery of the medium in
which it moves. Lilienthal built and flew kites, to which
he gave curved wings in imitation of those of birds
(<a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>). With one of these he obtained, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
only for a few moments, an actual gliding flight. The
incident is described by his brother Gustav:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;It (the kite) was held by three persons, one of whom took
hold of the two lines which were fastened to the front cane and
to the tail respectively, whilst the other two persons each held
the line which was fastened to each wing. In this way it was
possible to regulate the floating kite, as regards its two axes.
Once, in the autumn of 1874, during a very strong wind, we
were able to so direct the kite that it moved against the wind.
As soon as its long axis was approximately horizontal the kite
did not come down, but moved forward at the same level. I
held the cords controlling the longitudinal axis, and my brother
and my sister each one of the cords for the adjustment of the
cross-axis. As the kite maintained its lateral equilibrium, they
let go the cords; the kite then stood almost vertically above
me and I also had to free it. After another thirty steps forward
my cords got entangled in some bushes, the kite lost its balance,
and in coming down was destroyed. Yet, having gained another
experience, we easily got over the loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>From kites, in quest of a curved surface which
should give a maximum lift with a minimum resistance to its
own passage through the air, Lilienthal embarked upon
a series of tests with wing shapes; setting these up in
the wind upon suitable recording machines, and noting
patiently the data that could be procured. There are
many problems to be considered when planning a wing
for flight. If it is given a deep curve or camber from
front to back this may, while exercising a powerful lift,
offer too high a resistance as it passes through the air,
and thus waste the energy needed to propel the craft;
or, if its front edge is dipped too sharply, this may
cause the air to act upon its upper surface, and send
a machine diving headlong to the ground. The
planning of a successful wing becomes a compromise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
having for its object a surface which shall give the
greatest lifting influence with the least resistance.
Lilienthal, after much experiment and the examination
of the wings of many birds, decided that the curve,
camber, or upward arch of a plane should measure, at its
maximum depth, about one-twelfth of whatever width
the plane might have from front to back.

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /> <small>GLIDING FLIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">How a man may use gravity as a motor&mdash;Theory of
the &#8220;glider&#8221;&mdash;The craft Lilienthal built&mdash;A problem of balance&mdash;The
centres of gravity and pressure.</p>

<p>Up to this point in his research Lilienthal
had moved more or less upon the lines of other experimenters.
Had he continued to follow in their footsteps, he would
have planned some large and impracticable machine&mdash;and
perhaps gone no further. But although he
desired to test the lifting power of the planes he
had built, Lilienthal had always in mind this vital
fact&mdash;that a man must learn to balance himself in
the air before he can hope to fly. His own words,
in summing up this problem, were: &#8220;stability first;
propulsion afterwards&#8221;; and by this he meant a man
must acquire the art of handling a craft in the air,
before he dares to fit a motor and attempt power-driven flight.</p>

<p>But if a man used neither wing-beats nor a motor
to drive him through the air, how was such practice
to be obtained? Lilienthal solved the problem&mdash;and
made his name immortal&mdash;by devising a system in
which he used the force of gravity as his motor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
His plan was this: first he would build a pair of
large, light wings&mdash;so light in fact that, even with
the woodwork that was in them and with the
additional weight of a balancing tail, he could raise
them to his shoulders and run forward. With these
wings he would go to the summit of a sloping hill
and face what wind might be blowing&mdash;as he had
seen the young storks do. Then he would run
forward with his wings, so as to obtain the lifting
influence necessary before they could act upon the
air. And then, when the wind was sweeping under
his curved wings, he would raise his legs from the
ground and seek to soar or glide; his own weight,
and that of his machine, providing a gravity motor
or downward pulling influence, while the sustaining
power of his planes, resisting this drag, would send
him gliding through the air, only a few feet from
the ground, at an angle which tended gradually earthward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_21" id="Fig_21"></a>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p>
  <p class="blockquot">Paper glider, in which the cardboard weight (A.)
should be 3/10 inch wide, and 1/16 inch thick, slightly arch planes
upward (B.B.). Turn up a little flap at each end (C.C.).
An eighth inch is sufficient. Hold between finger and thumb
(the cardboard weight uppermost); then allow to dive,
as indicated by the dotted line.</p>
</div>

<p>This power of a weighted plane to glide,
even when no motive power is attached to it, may be
demonstrated quite simply by the little paper model
seen in <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>. If, when you have made this, you
allow it to flutter from your hand without any weight
attached, the model plunges, dips, and dives; it has
no forward motion, therefore it has no stability or
poise. But when you gum the small cardboard
weight to its fore-plane, the action of the model is
changed. By the use of this tiny strip of cardboard
you have, so to say, given it an engine; you have
provided it with means whereby it can obtain forward
motion, and so glide through the air. When you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
hold it as shown in the sketch, with the weighted
fore-plane tilted downward, and release it without
a jerk, the tendency for the model is to fall to the
ground as it did before. But now there is the weight to reckon
with: this pulls the model forward and downward, tending to
fall more quickly, of course, than the paper by itself
would do. But there is also the plane behind the falling
weight to be taken into consideration: jerked forward and downward
through the air, this begins to exercise a sustaining influence,
and so resists the falling movement of the weight.
Still the weight, actuated by the force of gravity,
pulls downward. But the plane refuses to fall sheer
to the ground; and yet the weight must have its
way. So, as in most situations of this kind, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is a compromise. The falling weight pulls; the plane
resists; and in a flash the model starts upon a
graceful glide. Its plane is fulfilling its task of bearing
it through the air; and the weight is carrying out
its mission also, in causing the glide to tend earthward.
So, pulled down by its weight and yet partly
sustained by its plane, the model will pass across
a room; and if its plane and its weight are in a nice
adjustment, one may see a pretty man&#339;uvre before
it reaches the floor. As it is swept faster through
the air, owing to the increasing drag of the weight,
the plane of the model acquires a greater lifting
influence; and the moment comes when this &#8220;lift,&#8221;
reaching a maximum, checks altogether the descending
movement, and causes the model actually to
ascend. Up indeed it goes, for a second, in a sudden
swerve. But this ascending impulse is soon checked;
gravity cannot be denied. The model loses speed;
and, as it loses speed, so does its plane lose lift.
Hence the weight is again the predominating partner;
it pulls down the fore-plane, converts the rise into
a fall, and brings the model with another dive to the floor.</p>

<p>But here, at all events, is a demonstration
of this theory of gliding flight&mdash;one that can be carried
out without a motor. Of course such flying has its
restrictions: a man must start from the summit of
a hill, and the glide is in the form of a descent
towards the ground below; but still he is passing
through the air; and above all&mdash;and this proved
the advantage of the scheme for such a pioneer as
Lilienthal&mdash;there is no need, during any such glide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
to pass high above the ground. The operator may,
in fact, if the side of his hill slopes gently, skim
within only a few feet of its surface; and this means
that, should he lose his balance at first, as he may
expect to do, he will not share the fate of those who
leapt from towers, but will be able to alight without mishap.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;Lilienthal Glider.</p>
</div>

<p>This, then, was Lilienthal&#8217;s plan; he would
build a machine with wings and a tail, stand facing the wind as
the storks had done, then seek to glide through the air
in the manner of a soaring bird. The idea underlying
his scheme was that he hoped, by a series of such gliding
flights, to learn the adjusting movements he knew would be
necessary to preserve his balance in the air. The gliding craft
Lilienthal built, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>,
has become an historical machine. The framework of its wings
and the supports of its tail were of willow, and
the wings and tail, to give them their grip upon the
air, were covered with a smoothly stretched fabric.
Then the whole structure was braced and tightened;
and though it weighed less than 50 lbs., it was strong
enough to bear its operator though the air. Lilienthal
could raise the apparatus upon his shoulders&mdash;passing
his head through the aperture between the planes, which
will be noted in the sketch&mdash;and walk or run forward;
and to hold the machine, as he carried it thus, he gripped
two wooden rods. The tail was flexible, being allowed
an automatic movement, thus giving the craft a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
natural stability. The main wings had a span of 24 feet,
and the machine measured 18 feet from front to tail.
The wings were cambered, according to the curve
Lilienthal had decided most efficient, and contained
about 180 square feet of lifting surface. In giving them
this area, Lilienthal was relying upon experiments he had
made; these showed that, as his machine glided through
the air, each square foot of its surface should bear a
weight equal to about 1 lb.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Although enthusiastic, Lilienthal was not
impatient: he had the priceless gift of judgment, allied to common-sense.
So, when he had his glider built, he made no
wild nor dangerous tests. He contented himself, in fact,
with a leap from a springboard no more than 3 feet high;
and this height he increased gradually to 8 feet. By
such humble beginnings, and without risking his life, he
proved that his glider would sustain his weight in the
air; or, to be more precise, that its wings would exercise
a lift sufficient to permit him to glide rather than fall to
the ground. So now he began more elaborate tests,
seeking hills which had gently-sloping sides, so that he
might glide down them. But with many the difficulty
was this: the winds near the surface, being broken and
disturbed, blew fitfully and in gusts, while what Lilienthal
needed was a steady, uniform wind. At length he found
favourable conditions at some gravel-pits at Südende; and
here, on the brink of a pit, he built a shed and housed his gliders.</p>

  <p class="blockquot space-below1">Here, actually in the air, and with its pilot

in 1906&mdash;the airman flew a distance of 230 yards.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Now, patient and assiduous, he began to teach
himself the art of aerial balance. Raising his wings to
his shoulders he would face the wind&mdash;which in his first
tests he did not care to be blowing at more than ten or
fifteen miles an hour. Then, running against the wind
to increase the pressure beneath his wings, he would
raise his legs and begin to glide, moving forward and at
the same time downward. How he appeared when in
flight is indicated by Fig. 23.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;Lilienthal gliding.</p>
</div>

<p>His first tests were brief, for the reason that
his craft would either dip too sharply, or incline its planes steeply
and so check its forward speed. In either event the
result was the same: the glide came to an end. But
Lilienthal&#8217;s caution saved him from being injured in an
involuntary descent. It must be remembered he was
always moving close to the earth; therefore he had only
a short distance to fall. To safeguard himself still
further he fitted below his machine a shock absorber,
which came into contact with the ground first and
lessened the force of any impact.</p>

<p>But the difficulties of preserving his balance
were great, as he had foreseen; for not only did his glider
dip down, or rear itself up, but also&mdash;under the influence
of wind-gusts&mdash;threatened to slip sideways. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Wilbur Wright, lecturing afterwards upon problems of
aerial equilibrium, who said crisply:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;The balancing of a gliding or flying machine is very simple
in theory; it merely consists in causing the centre of pressure
to coincide with the centre of gravity; but in actual practice
there seems to be an almost boundless incompatibility of
temperament between the two, which prevents their remaining
peaceably together for a single instant.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright">
  <a name="Fig_24" id="Fig_24"></a>
  <img src="images/figure24.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="414" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span>&mdash;Centres of gravity and pressure.</p>
</div>

<p>Here, in a sentence, is the problem. As a cambered
plane is moved in flight, the air-pressure upon it is not
disposed equally over the surface, but tends to locate
itself at a spot to the front of the middle line of the
plane. When a plane is at a normal inclination to the
air, indeed, this centre of pressure, as it is called, is
at a point upon the surface about one-third of the distance
between the front and rear edges. As to the centre of
gravity, the second factor in the problem, this may be
explained best, perhaps, by a practical illustration.
Take a small sheet of cartridge paper, cut to represent
the plane of a flying machine, and lay this along the
blade of a knife. By moving it to and fro and adjusting
its equilibrium, you will be able to make it rest upon
the knife-edge without falling forward or backward;
this point at which it balances itself represents its centre
of gravity. Here, then, are the forces: the centre of
pressure, which is the thrust of the air, and the centre
of gravity, which is the pull of the earth seeking to drag
down a machine when in flight. These two forces must,
as we have been told, be made to coincide. In the
next illustration (<a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a>) the problem is
made clearer. In diagram <b>A</b> is seen a plane <b>A.B.</b> which
is moving through the air in the direction indicated by the arrow.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
The two forces&mdash;that is to say, the centre of pressure
(<b>C.P.</b>) and the centre of gravity (<b>C.G.</b>)&mdash;coincide
with each other: therefore the plane is in equilibrium. But
now suppose a gust of wind strikes the plane. This
tends to tilt it upward; and the result is that the centres
of pressure and gravity show that &#8220;boundless incompatibility
of temperament&#8221; of which Wilbur Wright complained. The impact
of the gust, making the plane rear up, throws the centre of pressure
farther back along its surface, as is shown in diagram <b>B</b>.
The plane is at once out of balance. Or it may be argued that,
as it passes through the air, the wind pressure under the plane
is suddenly lessened. This would cause its front edge to drop;
whereupon the centre of pressure would, as is seen in diagram <b>C</b>,
move immediately forward upon the plane&mdash;and so throw it
out of balance again.</p>

<p>This is the problem of the man who would navigate
the air. He launches himself in a treacherous, unstable
element: constantly, beneath his wings, the air pressure
changes and varies in its strength; constantly is he
losing his balance&mdash;and as constantly must he regain
it. Imagine a man walking a tight-rope, and seeking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
incessantly to keep himself in equilibrium, and you have
a notion of what the first man faced when he strove to
fly. And his case, really, was worse than that of the
tight-rope walker. The latter is concerned mainly with
the danger of falling to one side or the other; he need
not trouble himself unduly with the problem of his fore
and aft stability. But the aerial acrobat may fall forward
or backward, or from side to side. Hence his
trick, once he masters it, is the more skilful.</p>

<p>The art, as has been shown, is to bring
together these centres of gravity and pressure; and it can
be done in either of two ways. One is to alter the
centre of gravity should the machine begin to fall, and
the other to move the centre of pressure. Lilienthal,
and others of the early gliders, adopted the plan first
mentioned; they shifted the centre of gravity. But
others who followed them, and notably the Wright
brothers, finding that they needed to build larger craft,
made use of movable planes by which they could shift
the centre of pressure; but this, of course, will be dealt
with in its place.</p>

<p>To alter the centre of gravity of a machine it
is necessary to move in some way the weight it carries&mdash;to
shift the load forward or backward, say, or from side to
side. In Lilienthal&#8217;s glider the load was the weight of his
own body, and he learned to move this when wind-gusts
struck his craft. His body, as he passed through the
air in flight, hung free from the shoulders below the
wings of his machine; he was therefore able to swing
himself forward or backward, or from side to side. And
this he did, counteracting the rolling movements of his
machine, and seeking always to prolong the glide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Should his craft be struck by a sudden gust, for example,
and heel to one side, he swung the weight of his body
towards the rising wing; should he dive abruptly, or
threaten to rise at an acute angle, he was ready with
a movement of his body to check the falling tendency
and restore the machine to an even keel. But the point
to be considered is this: all these movements, when a
craft is in flight, have to be made with a lightning
rapidity. There is not an instant to lose; not a fraction
of a second to be wasted while a man thinks what he is
to do. His balancing, if he would glide through the air
with wings, must be instinctive&mdash;instantaneous; as,
indeed, is the balancing of the birds. Here, then, is the
difficulty: to learn to make these balancing movements
with sufficient quickness; and this Lilienthal found to be
the stumbling-block. Time after time, while gliding
close to the ground, his machine lost its balance and,
before he could correct the slip or dive, had come to
earth. But these falls did not hurt him, nor did they
damage his machine; so he was able, like the storks, to
try again and again.</p>

<p>It is not easy to realise this difficulty of
learning to fly. The first airmen found their rate of thinking
too slow. For all earthly actions they could think quickly
enough; but when they came to pass through the air
they found the sending of a command from their brains
to their limbs was not done fast enough. They found
they could not rely upon <i>thinking</i> what to do when a
craft threatened to fall. They had to practise until
they acquired the power of making a balancing movement
without thinking at all; they learned, that is to
say, to keep their equilibrium by sub-conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
movements&mdash;or, to use a simpler word, by &#8220;instinct&#8221;; to
balance themselves as they passed through the air, like
a man balances himself when he rides a bicycle, without
giving the action a thought.</p>

<p>Lilienthal probed all these difficulties, and
saw that&mdash;as with other problems&mdash;it was not so much
brilliant daring that would bring him success, as a painstaking
course of practice, along right and sensible lines. So,
whenever the weather was favourable and the wind not
too high, he made his running leaps down the sides of
hills, being content as a rule, in all his early trials, if he
remained only a second or so in the air. Here, indeed,
was another difficulty of learning to fly. No experience
was possible unless a machine was in flight; and yet, in
making his first tests, Lilienthal had to be content with
a second&#8217;s practice here and a second there; to be glad
in fact if, after a whole month&#8217;s work, he had been for
one clear minute in the air.

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /> <small>&#8220;THE BIRD MAN&#8221;</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Construction of an artificial hill&mdash;The
building of larger craft&mdash;Peril of gusty winds&mdash;The accident which
caused Lilienthal&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>So determined was Lilienthal to obtain the best
conditions for his gliding that, finding no natural slope to meet
his purpose, he ordered the construction of an artificial
hill. This was built at Gross-Lichterfelde, near Berlin,
and was 50 feet high and had gently sloping sides from
which, at any direction of the wind, he could make a
soaring flight. On the top of the hill, which is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>, Lilienthal had a roomy chamber,
and in it he stored his craft. In this illustration, also, the airman
may be observed standing upon the hilltop, ready for a trial.
By means of dotted lines, and representations of machines
in flight, it is possible to show how he glided through the air.</p>

<p>In the upper of the two flights shown, profiting
by a day when there were rising currents in the wind, Lilienthal
had allowed himself to be lifted, for a moment or so, to
a point in the air actually higher than that from which
he started. Then, in order to obtain forward speed,
he dived, only to incline his wings more steeply again,
and allow the wind to bear him upward. In this way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
by exercising skill in the balancing of his machine, he
was able to prolong a glide, and under favourable conditions
to traverse, before touching ground, a distance
through the air of nearly 1000 feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>&mdash;Lilienthal&#8217;s artificial hill.</p>
</div>

<p>In the second of the glides shown in <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>,
Lilienthal is making a swift, low flight&mdash;one of those
during which he was never far from the ground, and
with which he contented himself in early tests. On
glancing again at this sketch it will be noted that the
upper of the craft shown has two main sustaining wings,
placed one over the other in the girder construction
already described. It is in fact a biplane, whereas the
lower machine is a monoplane&mdash;such a craft as was
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>. It was when Lilienthal
became expert at balancing himself in the air that he built a
machine on the biplane principle. His reason for doing
so was that he required more surface in the sustaining
wings, so that they might carry him farther through
the air. What he wanted to do in each of his glides
was to remain in the air as long as possible, and thus
gain a maximum of experience. The difficulty, as
explained, was to obtain enough practice. In five
years, for instance, although assiduous in his experiments,
Lilienthal was not more than five hours in the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright">
  <a name="Fig_26" id="Fig_26"></a>
  <img src="images/figure26.jpg" alt="_" width="199" height="122" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Lilienthal&#8217;s<br />Biplane Glider.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus it was that he built a biplane, each of
the wings being 18 feet in span, and containing 100 square feet
of surface. The craft is shown in <a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>.
Lilienthal did with it what he expected he would be able to do;
he increased materially the length of his glides. But there
were drawbacks in the use of this machine, and one
introduced an element of danger. With the monoplane,
so soon as he made balancing movements by instinct,
Lilienthal found he could control his craft quite well; it
was small, and responded quickly when he threw the weight of
his body from side to side. But the biplane, being considerably
larger, and having more surface upon which the wind could
act, was sluggish in its response to his controlling
movements. In the case of both monoplane and biplane,
Lilienthal relied merely upon the weight of his body to
counteract falling movements. In the biplane, therefore,
although it required a greater leverage to restore its
balance, he was unable to increase the correcting influence.
This difficulty, in the use of a large machine, was
faced subsequently by the Wrights, and how they solved
it will be shown.</p>

<p>Lilienthal recognised the position, of course,
and saw there might be peril in the use of a biplane; but he was
content, none the less, to rely upon his skill. In each
glide he made he became more expert; instead of allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
his machine to slip to the ground when struck by a
gust, he restored its equilibrium by an instantaneous
movement of his body: he was, in fact, like a man who
had learned to ride a bicycle&mdash;balancing himself without
pausing to think what he should do. But Lilienthal, in
his navigation of the air, was facing a danger the cyclist
has not to fear. He was braving dangerous wind-gusts;
and he did not know, and had no means of knowing,
with just what strength these gusts would strike his craft.
Also&mdash;and this too was a danger no man on earth
need fear&mdash;he had empty air below him should he fall.
The peril grew greater as his skill increased, because
he soared higher, and left greater distances between
him and the ground below. In another way, also, he
courted greater risk; and this was through gliding in
stronger winds. At first, when he was unskilled, he had
cared only to brave a wind of a velocity, say, of 10 or
15 miles an hour. But soon, feeling his balancing
power grow greater, he ventured into the air when there
was a wind of from 20 to 25 miles an hour.</p>

<p class="space-below2">In regard to this question of the strength
of the wind, uncertainty often exists. What, for example, is a &#8220;stiff
breeze&#8221;? What is a &#8220;strong wind&#8221;? And at what velocity must
the wind blow before it is called a gale? Such questions are often asked,
and the table below should prove instructive:

  <img src="images/figure27.jpg" alt="_" width="199" height="142" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;Lilienthal combating a wind-gust.</p>
</div>

<p>In gliding in a breeze, say of 25 miles an hour, Lilienthal
had to face this danger, and it is one all airmen meet: whereas the average
strength of a wind may be maintained at 25 miles an hour, there is
no assurance that there will not be a sudden and heavy gust of a
greater force than this. Sometimes, when the
wind is uncertain, there will come a gust which has double
the force of the normal pressure; and such a gust, sweeping
unexpectedly against an aircraft, threatens to blow
it over and send it headlong to the ground. Thus
Lilienthal, having no more control over his machine
than could be brought to bear by movements of his body,
was running a considerable risk when he soared in gusty
winds&mdash;particularly if using the biplane form of craft.
Sometimes, when struck by a gust, his glider would heel
and assume a dangerous position in the air such as is
illustrated in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>. Here the craft threatens to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
fall backwards and partly sideways; and the operator
can be seen throwing his body and legs forward, in a
quick effort to check this overturning impulse.</p>

<p>One incident, indicating the risks Lilienthal
ran, should be mentioned: he was gliding 50 feet high one
day, in a fresh wind, when one of the wooden arm
supports, which he gripped while in flight, broke
suddenly and threw his craft out of balance. The
machine, before he could right it, fell heavily to the
ground; but, thanks to the shock-absorber below the
wings, Lilienthal escaped with nothing worse than bruises.</p>

<p>He had set himself to master this art of balance,
and master it he did, and was ready to risk his life in
so doing. In the year 1896 he was bold enough to
glide from hills 250 feet high; and from such a height
he would come sweeping through the air, often traversing
before alighting a distance of 750 feet. Sometimes,
too, on a day when the wind was high, he would stand
upon the hilltop and allow the wind pressure under his
wings to raise him in the air; then, throwing his
weight forward, he would start his craft on a downward
glide. Frequently, when experimenting in strong
winds, he would find himself higher than his starting-point,
and would hang almost motionless for a moment
or so, soaring in the air. But such hovering flight,
though he practised assiduously, he found difficult to
maintain. He could not keep his machine poised in
an ascending current of wind; he had not that instinct
of the birds which enables them to profit instantly by
each rising gust, and hold themselves in it as they allow
it to bear them upward. Soaring flight has a fascination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
for those who study the navigation of the air; but no
man, as yet, has been able to indulge in it for more
than the briefest space of time. It is only possible to
hover thus, without effort or the use of a motor, when
the forces that govern a machine are exactly in balance;
that is to say, the power of gravity which is pulling
downwards must be balanced perfectly by the strength
of the wind, which is blowing under the planes of the
machine and tending to force it upward. Should the
wind fail in its thrust, then the craft will move forward
and downward; should the wind blow more strongly,
then it will drive the machine backward, and tend to
throw it out of equilibrium. Some birds, profiting by
the skill they have in the minute adjustment of their
wings, are able to hover over a given spot at will,
remaining motionless in the air, without flap or visible effort.</p>

<p>But Lilienthal, although he never attained
such proficiency as might enable him to soar indefinitely
above the hill from which he sprang, was always confident
that some perfect glider would be invented, and
men thus be able to imitate the birds. It was when
writing upon this problem of soaring flight that he
expressed the thought:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;It is not to be wondered at that birds are able to perceive
the slightest variations in the movements of the air, because
the whole of their body surface acts as an organ for this sensation;
the long and widely extended wings constitute a sensitive
feeling lever, and minute sensibility will be particularly concentrated
in the follicles from which the feathers issue, just as
is the case with our finger-tips.... Should it ever become
possible for man to imitate the splendid sailing movements of
birds, he will not require to use steam engines or electro-motors
for the purpose; a light, properly shaped, and sufficiently
moveable wing, and the necessary practice in its manipulation
is all that will be required of him. He should, unconsciously,
be able to draw the greatest advantages from whatever wind
may be blowing, by properly presenting the wings.&#8221;</p>

<p>When three years of gliding lay behind him,
Lilienthal thought he could go little farther in this research.
He was able to balance himself in the air; he could glide
in high winds; but always, seeing that he had no motive
power with which to drive his craft, he must start from
a hilltop and descend to the ground. Now he sought
longer and bolder flight; and so he and his brother discussed
the building of an engine which might propel a
glider through the air. No petrol motor, unfortunately
for Lilienthal, was then available; so he planned to
construct a carbonic acid motor, and make this drive
his craft by flapping the ends of its wings.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1896 he was busy with plans
for this motor, while still continuing his flights; but in
August he decided to cease gliding for a while, and
await a test of the power-driven craft. So on Sunday,
August 9th, he said he would travel out to Stollen,
make one or two final flights, and pack up his machine.
His brother Gustav was to have accompanied him as
usual, but had a mishap with his bicycle, and so remained
behind. What happened is described, in few but expressive
words, by Gustav Lilienthal:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;Our families, whom we had intended to take with us,
remained at home, and my brother drove out, accompanied
by a servant. He intended to make some change on the
rudder, but at the very first glide, the wind being uncertain, the
apparatus, when at a considerable height, lost its balance.
Unfortunately my brother had not fitted the shock-absorber, and
the full shock of the fall took effect, so that the apprehension
of our uncle was fulfilled. My brother fell, a victim to the great
idea which&mdash;although at that time so little recognised&mdash;is now
acknowledged in its full bearing by the whole civilised world.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the moment his machine lost balance, Lilienthal
was more than 100 feet in the air. Striking the ground
with great violence, he sustained injuries which were
almost immediately fatal. In his work, to which he
sacrificed his life, he had met with no encouragement or
recognition. He suffered the fate of pioneers; his
theories were so far ahead of his time that folk did not
grasp their significance. Little interest seems to have
been taken in his glides; there was no sensation; there
were no crowds. Nobody, in fact, realised what he was
doing, or appreciated the vast importance of these
seemingly simple tests. But in the years that followed,
when other men came to grips with the problem as
Lilienthal had done, when they were able to use the
data he had compiled and to profit by his experiences
in actual flight, then this pioneer came into his own.</p>

<p>His work, summarised, may be said to lie
in this: he provided a stepping-stone to power-driven flight.
He showed men that they should learn to balance
themselves in the air <i>before</i>, and not <i>after</i>,
they had built themselves costly craft. How his example acted
as a spur upon others, and how the work he had begun
was carried to its triumph, will be the purpose of our
next chapters to show.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /> <small>WILBUR AND ORVILLE WRIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">How two American engineers followed up
Lilienthal&#8217;s work&mdash;Their biplane glider and its ingenious control&mdash;First
experiments and successes.</p>

<p>For those who might care to study them, Lilienthal
had written papers and essays as explanations of his
work, and when the news of his death was flashed round
the world, inventors were induced to turn to these
teachings and read for themselves what he had done.
Among those who were interested were two young
Americans, unknown then, but now world-famous&mdash;Wilbur
and Orville Wright. Living in Dayton, Ohio,
they were the sons of Milton Wright, a prominent church
worker of that city, and they carried on a bicycle store
and engineer&#8217;s shop. Both were born engineers&mdash;keen,
clever, patient, and enthusiastic in their work; and
they had discussed many times&mdash;before they read of
Lilienthal&#8217;s death&mdash;the problem of building an aeroplane.
Now this interest was re-awakened; and as Wilbur
Wright himself said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;The brief notice of his (Lilienthal&#8217;s) death which appeared
in the telegraphic news at that time, aroused a passive interest
which had existed from my childhood, and led me to take down
from the shelves of our home library a book on &#8220;Animal
Mechanism&#8221; by Professor Marey, which I had already read
several times. From this I was led to read more modern
works, and as my brother soon became equally interested with
myself, we passed from the reading to the thinking, and finally
to the working stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>What the Wrights first set themselves to
do was to investigate previous data. They wanted to prove,
if they could, whether this data was sound or badly
reasoned: they needed a firm and definite basis of
their own before they would build any large machine.
So they tested the theories of their predecessors and
made experiments, particularly as to the sustaining
power of surfaces of various shapes and curves. To
this end they built and flew kites, studying the lift
they exercised; then they decided to build a light
gliding machine, such as Lilienthal had used. But
there was a drawback to be faced in all such practical
work, and the Wrights saw it clearly; this was to get
a sufficient amount of actual flying. It was Wilbur
who wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;It seemed to us that the main reason why the problem
had remained so long unsolved was that no one had been able
to obtain any adequate practice. It would not be considered
at all safe for a bicycle rider to attempt to ride through a
crowded city street after only five hours&#8217; practice, spread out in
bits of 10 seconds each over a period of five years; yet Lilienthal,
with this brief practice, was remarkably successful in meeting
the fluctuations and eddies of the wind gusts.&#8221;</p>

<p>They made up their minds to build a glider
with ample wing-surface, so that it would be sustained in
light breezes, and to take the machine to where they
might be sure of a steady wind, and there fly it as a kite;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
allow it, that is to say, to ascend into the air at the end
of a rope, and hold it steady against the wind while the
operator practised his balancing movements.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_28" id="Fig_28"></a>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;The 1900 Wright Glider (operator&#8217;s position).</p>
</div>

<p>Their first glider was a biplane, with 165 square
feet of lifting surface, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a>;
several of its features need explanation. First there is the
position of the operator; he can be seen lying prone
across the centre of the lower plane. This attitude was
adopted by the Wrights to minimise wind-pressure.
Should a man be upright in his machine, they calculated
that his body would, as the glider passed through the
air, offer an appreciable resistance; while, in lying flat,
he would offer scarcely any resistance at all.</p>

<p>A small horizontal plane will be noted in front
of the main-planes; this was to govern the rising and descending
of the machine. The Wrights came to the conclusion
that any body-moving method for controlling their
craft, such as Lilienthal had adopted, would not be
sufficiently powerful in a wind. Lilienthal, it will be
remembered, had found his control weaken when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
used a machine of large surface. So the Wrights
decided that, instead of altering the centre of gravity of
their machine when gusts struck it, they would leave
the centre of gravity immovable and shift the centre of
pressure upon their planes. This was done partly by
the elevating plane, as it came to be called. Tilted
upward, this had the effect of raising the front of the
glider, and causing the centre of pressure to travel backward
upon the planes. Tilted down, it made the planes
dip forward, and brought the centre of pressure nearer
their front edge. When he wanted to rise, the pilot
raised the elevator; when he wished to glide earthward,
he inclined it down. Here, indeed, was the method
such as was described in <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a>, when
dealing with the machine Sir Hiram Maxim built; and this system
of the lifting plane is worthy of special mention. In one
way or another, fitted in front of the planes or behind
them, it is the recognised method for controlling the
rise or descent of an aeroplane.</p>

<p>Apart from governing the ascending or
descending movement, there was the question of preventing
a machine from slipping sideways; and this the Wrights
solved ingeniously. They saw, of course, that when
their glider lurched to one side or the other, they would
need some power to tilt it back again. So they devised
a system by which the plane-ends of their machine&mdash;being
made flexible&mdash;might be warped, or caused to
shift up and down. This action the operator controlled,
as he lay across the lower plane, by a movement of
cords, and its operation is shown in <a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>.
The effect upon the machine may be described thus: should
a wind-gust tilt down one plane-end, the &#8220;warp&#8221; upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that side of the machine was drawn down also, and the
effect of this&mdash;seeing that it caused the plane to assume
a steeper angle to the air and exercise a greater lift&mdash;was
to raise the plane-ends that had been driven down
by the gust. By a system of connecting the control
cords, this balancing influence was made to act with
double force; when one wing warped down, the other
moved up; and, in this way, while the side of the
machine tilted down was made to rise, the other plane-ends,
which had been lifted, were made to descend. A
dual righting influence was thus obtained. This system,
which imitates the flexing movements made by a bird,
was an important device; the Wrights patented it&mdash;combining
the movement with an action of the rudder&mdash;and
brought cases at law to enforce their rights.</p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;The Wright Wing-warp.</p>
</div>

<p>In the summer of 1900, with their first machine,
the brothers went for experiments to Kitty Hawk, North
Carolina. They had chosen this lonely settlement,
located on a strip of land that divides Albemarle Sound
from the Atlantic Ocean, because they hoped it would
provide them with a strong, steady wind; there were also,
fairly close to the settlement, suitable sand-hills for gliding.</p>

<p>Upon the first day of their trials the wind
was blowing at nearly 30 miles an hour, and they allowed the
glider to rise as a kite. Flown in this way, it bore the
weight of a man; but they were disappointed at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
position it assumed when in the air. Its planes set
themselves at an angle which was too steep, and it
seemed to give less lifting power than they had expected.
They tested their system of control, and found that the
wing-warping for sideway balance acted extremely well,
proving quicker and more certain than would the
shifting from side to side of the operator&#8217;s body.
The elevating plane was also efficient.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>&mdash;Launching the Wright Glider.</p>
</div>

<p>Then they took the glider to the sand-hills.
At first the wind was too high, but after waiting a day it
dropped to 14 miles an hour, and they were able to
make nearly a dozen glides down the side of a slope
which had a drop of 1 foot in 6. It had been their idea,
in building the machine, that the operator should run
before gliding, as Lilienthal had done, and only lie
upon the plane when the speed was sufficient to give
the surfaces their lift. But in practice they found a
better method than this. Two assistants, as illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>, took the machine by its plane-ends and ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
forward with it, the pilot assuming beforehand his
position upon the plane; then, when they had gained a
pace sufficient for the machine to soar, they released
their hold and it glided forward. Beneath the glider,
under the centre of the lower plane, there were two
wooden skates or runners, and these took the weight of
the machine when it alighted, and allowed it to slide
forward across the ground before coming to rest. By
the use of these landing skids, and by steering at as
fine an angle as possible, the Wrights found they could
touch ground, even at 20 miles an hour and lying across
the machine, without injury either to themselves or the craft.</p>

<p>The first glides were short, and all close
to the ground; but they bore out the tests when the machine
had been flown as a kite, and showed that the elevating
plane and wing-warp would do their work. The
Wrights were, indeed, astonished at the celerity with
which the glider responded to the fore-plane.</p>

<p>Writing afterwards of this first visit to
Kitty Hawk, Wilbur summarised the experiments thus:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below3">
&#8220;Although the hours and hours of practice we had hoped
to obtain finally dwindled down to about two minutes, we were
very much pleased with the general results of the trip, for
setting out as we did with almost revolutionary theories on
many points and an entirely untried form of machine, we
considered it quite a point to be able to return without having
our pet theories completely knocked on the head by the hard
logic of experience, and our own brains dashed out into the bargain.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
When they came to plan a new craft for
the summer of 1901, they agreed they could not better
either the theory or the manipulation of their first
machine; but they decided to make one nearly double
the size. Their reason for doing this was that, having
a greater lifting surface, they hoped to fly in quite
light breezes and also prolong their glides; and they
were encouraged to build a larger machine by the
readiness with which the first had responded to its
controls. They therefore constructed a biplane which
had 308 instead of 165 square feet of surface, and
was the largest machine of its kind that had been built.</p>

<p>In July they went into camp on their
remote sand-hills, housing the new machine in a wooden shed.
The first tests were made in a 13-mile-an-hour wind,
but proved disappointing. The machine dived, in
spite of a quick movement of the elevator, and
landed after gliding only a short distance. The cause
was found to be this: the centre of gravity was too
far forward. Therefore the pilot took his place some
few inches farther back. But in the next glide the
craft behaved alarmingly. It reared almost vertically
in the air, and would have slipped backwards had
not the operator turned down the elevator to its limit,
and moved his body forward as well. The machine, when
he did this, recovered its balance and settled without injury.</p>

<p>Further tests were made and the curve of the
planes reduced&mdash;a change which could be effected by
altering the trussing of the ribs. Then they obtained
striking success. One glide, for instance, measured
a distance of 366 feet; and this was bettered by
one of 389 feet; while the operator found that he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
perfect control over his machine in a wind of 14 miles
an hour. A day or so later an attempt was made in
a wind of 22 miles an hour, and was successful. Then,
in subsequent tests, they glided in a wind as strong
as 27 miles an hour.</p>

<p>The success of these trials led them to think
of fitting a motor to their machine; and they calculated
at first that a petrol engine of about 6 h.p., weighing
100 lbs., would be sufficient to drive a craft through
the air; but they hoped to obtain one more powerful
than this. Here it should be pointed out that, owing
to the experiments of motor-car builders, and the
spending of many thousands of pounds, there was
now available a petrol motor which might be adapted
to aviation. Such engines were heavily built&mdash;when
considered, that is, from the point of view of fitting
to aeroplanes; and the brothers agreed that, as they
wanted such a motor for aerial use, and not for placing
in a car, they would probably need to build one,
specially lightened, in their own workshops.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <small>THE WRIGHT MOTOR-DRIVEN PLANE</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Final gliding tests&mdash;Building of the
motor&mdash;How a petrol engine works&mdash;Driving, control, and launching
of the Wright machine.</p>

<p>Although everything induced them to hasten&mdash;for
they feared another inventor might forestall them with
a power-driven craft&mdash;the Wrights still went methodically
to work, refusing to use a motor until they had
gained a fuller knowledge of the air. So they built
more gliders, and with one of them&mdash;that used in
1902&mdash;they were able to make over a thousand flights.
Only once, in all their practice, did they come near
disaster; and this was one day when Orville was
testing a machine. The accident was described by Wilbur Wright:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;My brother Orville started on a flight with one wing
slightly higher than the other. This caused the machine to
veer to the left. He waited a moment to see whether it would
right itself, but finding that it did not, then decided to apply
the control. At the very instant he did this, however, the
right wing most unexpectedly rose much higher than before,
and led him to think that possibly he had made a mistake. A
moment of thought was required to assure himself that he had
made the right motion, and another to increase the movement.
Meanwhile he had neglected the front rudder, by which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
fore-and-aft balance was maintained. The machine turned up
in front more and more till it assumed a most dangerous
attitude. We who were on the ground noticed this in advance
of the aviator, who was thoroughly absorbed in the attempt
to restore the lateral balance, but our shouts of alarm were
drowned by the howling of the wind. It was only when the
machine came to a stop and started backward that he at length
realised the true situation. From the height of nearly 30 feet
the machine sailed diagonally backward till it struck the
ground. The unlucky aeronaut had time for one hasty glance
behind him, and the next instant found himself the centre of a
mass of fluttering wreckage. How he escaped injury I do not
know, but afterwards he was unable to show a scratch or bruise
anywhere, though his clothes were torn in one place.&#8221;</p>

<p>The amount of practice the brothers obtained
began to tell its tale, and they became sufficiently experienced
to glide in winds of 37 miles an hour. It was
Wilbur who, emphasising this need for constant flying,
declared: &#8220;By long practice, the management of a
machine should become as instinctive as the balancing
movements a man unconsciously employs with every
step in walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the experience with the 1902 machine,
and not before, did the brothers feel encouraged to build
a craft with a motor. They decided to construct the
engine themselves, so that they might have it ready
for use in 1903. They were capable engineers, they
had their own workshops, and above all they knew
just what they wanted. So they made a petrol engine
with four cylinders, developing about 25 horse-power.
It was water-cooled, and followed upon the lines of
a motor-car engine&mdash;save that it was lightened where
they considered weight could be spared. As a matter
of fact, when compared with the light and ingenious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
motors afterwards made in France, this engine was
a heavy and clumsy piece of work, weighing as it
did about 200 lbs. But they had calculated what
load their machine would bear; and they wanted to
ensure that the motor should run reliably. They
attempted, therefore, no drastic cutting down of weight.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;Man lifting<br />
a 100 horse-power<br />aeroplane motor.</p>
</div>

<p>An explanation may well be interposed as to the
working of the petrol motor, seeing that it plays so large a part in
aviation. First should be remembered the steam engine and its
disadvantages&mdash;its boiler, weight of water, and need for a heating
agent to make this water boil. In the petrol-motor none of these are
required&mdash;none, at least, save a tank with liquid fuel and another,
a smaller tank, containing lubricating oil. Beyond these tanks and
their contents, the weight of the engine is no more than the
weight of metal which composes it; and so it is possible, with a
specially-lightened motor, to deliver one horse-power of energy
for a weight of less than 3 lbs. How lightly a petrol
engine can be made was demonstrated by the firm constructing
the Antoinette motor, with which many of the
pioneers fitted their craft. A 16-cylinder engine was
made so that a man could raise it upon his shoulders&mdash;as
shown in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>&mdash;and carry it
without much difficulty; and yet this same motor, which one man
could lift from the ground, developed 100 horse-power.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>The principle of the petrol engine is simple.
From the tank containing petrol runs a pipe, and the liquid
passes through this into the carburettor,&mdash;a small
chamber in which the petrol is vapourised and made to
mix with air and so become explosive. Petrol is a
liquid which, when in contact with air, evaporates in the
form of vapour, and this forms a powerful explosive,
only needing a spark to ignite it. In the carburettor,
therefore, the petrol and air are mingled until
they form an explosive mixture, then they pass
through another pipe to the engine itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_32" id="Fig_32"></a>
  <img src="images/figure32.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="507" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;The
working of a petrol motor.</p>
</div>

<p>The petrol engine resembles a steam engine in these
respects: it has a cylinder in which the driving force is compressed,
a piston-rod this driving power pushes down, and
a fly-wheel the piston actuates, and which carries
round the piston-rod by its momentum, pushing it
towards the top of the cylinder again after one down
stroke, so that it may obtain another thrust. What
the fly-wheel does, in a word, is to store up energy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
between each thrust upon the piston, and thus keep the
motor in regular motion.</p>

<p>In starting an engine, the petrol tap is turned
on, and some of the spirit allowed to run into the carburettor.
Then, usually with a handle, the engine is made to
revolve so that the piston-rod moves down inside the
cylinder and sucks in the explosive mixture. As the
piston sinks in the cylinder, it draws in a charge of
the gas; then rising again, it compresses this charge
between the head of the piston and the top of the
cylinder. Now comes the moment when, if the most
forcible thrust is to obtained from the air and gas, it
should be ignited, and this is done by causing an electric
spark to jump between two metal points on what is
called the sparking-plug. This plug is screwed into the
head of the cylinder; the sparking end is inside the
cylinder where the gas charge is compressed, and to the
outside are fixed wires which run to the magneto&mdash;a small
electrical machine which, driven by the motor, makes
sparks in the plug each time the gas is to be fired.
Just at the right instant, therefore, the spark flashes in
the cylinder, and the gas is exploded. Being compressed
within the walls and top of the cylinder, the explosion
can only exert its force in one way&mdash;upon the head of
the piston, to which it gives a sudden downward thrust.
The power is transmitted to the fly-wheel, which is set
in motion, and thus the engine runs, driven by the
series of explosions which takes place in the cylinder.</p>

<p>The majority of petrol engines operate upon
what is known as the four-stroke principle. This action is as
follows: First the pistons are driven down by a charge
of gas, then they ascend in the cylinders so that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
spent and useless gas fumes may be forced out through
valve ports; then the pistons descend again so that a
fresh charge may be drawn into the cylinders, and then,
for a fourth time, the pistons move so that the gas may
be compressed and fired. During the period the engine
is not driven by the explosions, the fly-wheel has to do
its work, carrying the piston up and down while it
expels waste gas and obtains a new supply. In <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>
is a diagram to illustrate the principle of the petrol
engine and it amplifies this explanation.</p>

<p>An additional point is needed to explain how
motors were lightened for aviation work. The fly-wheel has been
described as vital to the engine, and so it is, unless a
number of cylinders are used. But if a maker builds a
motor with, say, eight cylinders, the driving impulses are so
frequent that there is no danger of the engine ceasing to
revolve between explosions, even if no fly-wheel is fitted.
It can be so arranged, indeed, by the timing of the
explosions, that there is a smooth, even thrust upon the
crank-shaft, and by omitting the fly-wheel there is a
perceptible lessening in the weight of the motor.</p>

<p>When the Wrights had built an engine, there
was still the question how they should make it drive their
aeroplane. They inclined naturally to the idea of an
aerial propeller such as that illustrated in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>.
Two courses lay open to them; they could fit one propeller
running at high speed and coupled directly to the motor,
or they could use two propellers, revolving at slower speed
and geared in some way to the engine. They decided
upon the latter course, placing two propellers behind the
main planes of their machine and driving them from the
engine by means of light chains, these running in guiding
tubes. This system of propulsion is shown in <a href="#Fig_33">Fig. 33</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="blockquot">A. Motor; B. Gear-wheels upon motor crank-shaft; C.C. Tubes carrying
driving chains; D.D. Sprocket-wheels over which chains pass; E.E. Propellers.</p>
</div>

<p>The propellers revolved in opposite directions,
and in order to gain this effect one chain, as will
be seen from the sketch, had to be crossed in its tube.
The Wrights preferred the use of two propellers, even
though this necessitated gearing such as might have
been avoided had a single propeller been coupled directly
to the motor. They considered the thrust upon the
aeroplane would be smoother with two screws. By
using a couple of large propellers also, and running
them rather slowly, they reckoned to obtain more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
efficiency than with a single high-speed screw. In
illustration of this it may be mentioned that, whereas
the single propellers upon some of the French machines
made 1000 or 1500 revolutions a minute, the Wrights&#8217;
two screws made only 450 a minute. That their
system was extremely efficient they were able to prove
beyond question. Many critics condemned as clumsy
the use of gearing chains, and pointed out the danger
that existed should a chain break&mdash;causing one propeller
to stop, while the other, by continuing its thrust, tended
to throw the machine out of equilibrium. Such a
system, indeed, never came into general use, but in
fairness to the Wrights it should be said that very few
accidents were ever attributed to the breaking of a chain.</p>

(two narrow vertical planes); D. Motor; E. Propellers;

</div>

<p>It is now possible to describe, as a completed
craft, the Wright power-driven plane; <a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>
shows its appearance; and in looking at it one is struck by the
fact that, save for one or two modifications, and the
fitting of motor and propellers, the machine is practically
a glider, such as the Wrights used for soaring tests. Of
the changes to be observed, the most interesting concern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the elevator and rear-rudder. The former, it will be
seen, has a double plane; it is, in fact, a smaller biplane
on the principle of the main-planes. Needing to increase
the surface of the elevator, the brothers fixed one
plane above another so as to make the construction
stronger and occupy less space. The rear-rudder, acting
like that of a ship, worked upon the system described in
<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>. With this, as with the elevator,
in order to economise space and obtain rigidity, two narrow planes
were fitted side by side.</p>

<p>So now the practical aircraft stood
complete&mdash;each part adapted and perfected; and, having
traced its development step by step, we see how the pioneers
had helped the Wrights to their conquest. Sustaining
planes, propellers, controlling surfaces&mdash;all had been
foreshadowed, all hinted at and sketched crudely; but
what had been lacking was the skill which should put
these theories into shape; and this skill, and also this
patience, Wilbur and Orville Wright provided to the full.</p>

<p>Having discussed the construction of the machine,
the method by which it was controlled when in the air may
be described. In <a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a> the operator is
seen in the driving seat; and near him will be observed the motor
which drives the craft. In his left hand&mdash;that is to say
in the one nearest us&mdash;he grasps the lever which operates
the elevating planes. The rod from lever to plane can
be seen, and the motions the pilot makes are these:
should he wish to rise, he draws the lever towards him
and tilts up the elevating planes in the manner already
described, increasing the lifting power of the main-planes
and so causing the machine to ascend; by a
reverse movement of the lever&mdash;by pushing it away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from him, that is to say&mdash;he makes the craft glide downward.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="blockquot space-below1">A. Motor; B. Lever operating elevating planes;
C. Lever working rudder and wing-warp.</p>
</div>

<p>In the pilot&#8217;s right hand is another lever;
this combines two actions in an ingenious way. It actuates
not only the rear-rudder of the machine, but also the
wing-warping for the control of sideway balance. How
the one rod combines these operations is shown by
<a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>. Here, looking from behind, one sees
the lever which the aviator holds. Towards the lower end is a rod
projecting rearwards, and this is coupled to the extremity
of another rod set at right angles to it, and pivoted in its
centre; while from this pivoted rod run the wires which
operate the rudder-planes. If the pilot swings his
hand-lever either forward or backward, it moves to and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
fro the rod which is connected with it, and this imparts a
forward or backward movement to the pivoted rod, with
the result that one or other of the rudder wires is drawn
forward&mdash;thus turning the rudder-planes from side to side.</p>

<p>The hand-lever is free also to move from side
to side; and if it is so moved it will draw with it the swinging
rod which projects from the end of it&mdash;below that
operating the rudders&mdash;and to the upright section of which the
wing-warping wires are fixed. A movement either side upon
the hand-level will pull over the wing-warping wires, therefore,
and bring the flexible plane-ends into operation. Thus
the dual movement of the lever is obtained&mdash;forward and
backward for the rudder, from side to side for the warp.</p>

<p>The Wrights did not use their feet in any controlling

for pushing upon a bar and operating the rudder of the machine; but
the Wrights preferred to make all actions with their hands.

</div>

<p>Details of propulsion and control being arranged,
there remained the question of how the machine should
be launched into the air. In their gliding tests, it will
be remembered, the Wrights employed assistants, who
held the machine by the wing-tips and ran forward with
it. But the weight of the power-driven machine, and
its greater size, prevented such a plan as this. They
decided, therefore, to launch it from a rail, and to aid its
forward speed, at the moment of taking the air, by a
derrick and a falling weight. This method is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a>. The biplane is seen mounted upon
a truck, or under-carriage, which runs upon wheels along a rail.
To the front of the aeroplane is fixed a rope, which
passes round a pulley some distance ahead of it, and is
then carried back to the derrick, from which can be seen
hanging a heavy weight. Before making a flight the
engine was set in motion, whirling the two propellers;
then, at a given signal, the weight upon the derrick was
released. Drawn forward by the pull of this weight, and
aided by the thrust of its propellers, the biplane moved
rapidly along the rail, and soon attained a speed of more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
than thirty miles an hour. Then, just before the end of
the rail was reached, the pilot released a catch which
freed the aeroplane from its trolley, tilted up his elevating
plane and the machine, now moving fast enough for its
planes to sustain it in flight, glided from earth to air,
flying low at first but gradually increasing his altitude.

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /> <small>DAWN OF FLIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">The Wrights complete their conquest&mdash;First trials
of the power-driven machine&mdash;Their negotiations with Governments&mdash;How
these hung fire and caused delay&mdash;Activity in France&mdash;Santos-Dumont,
Farman, and Delagrange.</p>

<p>Now, as they stood upon the threshold of
success, the method and patience of the Wrights came strikingly
to their aid. Their machine was not strange to them&mdash;not
a monster they had no notion of controlling, as
the first of the large machines had been to those who
built them. They had flown almost precisely similar
craft in their gliding tests; they knew the system of
control; knew how to make a landing after flight. All
this experience they had gained before attempting to
drive a machine with a motor; and herein lay the secret
of their success. They were not superhuman; they were
instead talented, patient, assiduously-careful men; and
their triumph goes to prove what can be done if a man
will work in the right way, is quietly and persistently
enthusiastic, and ignores all disappointments and rebuffs.</p>

<p class="space-below2">It was in December 1903 that the power-driven
machine was piloted in its first flights, the longest of
which lasted for one second less than a minute. But
the ascents from the earth were made without mishap,
the machine was under control while it flew, and it
landed without injury.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
And this was the beginning. Here was a machine
that would not merely glide from a hilltop; it would
sweep in any direction, and sustain its flight without
falter or flag, so long as its engine drove it through the
air. The craft was crude; its motor awkward to &#8220;tune&#8221;
for a spell of running; and the brothers were novices in
the element they invaded. They did not proclaim their
triumph, therefore, or declare themselves conquerors.
They said nothing. In their gliding tests, and even
with the power-driven machine, they had attracted little
public attention. Mild interest had been taken; but
the scene of their work was remote and lonely; and
what news leaked to the cities was disbelieved or treated with
unconcern. The world did not know what had been accomplished.</p>

<p>At the end of 1903, as stated, they first
flew with the motor-driven machine; and during the next two
years they did nothing to exploit the invention, being
content to increase their skill and lengthen their flights:
even with the problem solved, they refused to hurry.
The best performance in 1904 was a flight of 5
minutes 4 seconds. Circles in the air were now effected,
and the aeroplane was instantly responsive to its
controls. Then in 1905 a great stride was made,
Wilbur remaining in the air for 38 minutes&mdash;wheeling,
circling, rising, and falling; showing, in fact, that he
had perfect mastery over his machine.</p>

<p>But now rumours of the Wrights&#8217; triumph began
to reach the world; and at a meeting of the Aeronautical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
Society in England a sensation was caused one evening
when Mr. Patrick Alexander, reading a letter he had
received from the Wrights, was able to announce that
their aeroplane had flown for 24 miles. Interest was
aroused everywhere, and newspaper correspondents
hastened to interview the Wrights and photograph
their machine. But they were disappointed. Having
proved to their own satisfaction that their biplane was
a success, the Wrights dismantled it and packed it
away, doing no more flying. Thus the reports that
were telegraphed round the world were mainly hearsay,
and people refused to believe that the Wrights had
done what was claimed. They themselves said little,
but were busy with plans; and what they sought was to
sell the secret of their aeroplane to a Government.
They foresaw the future of the aeroplane as a weapon
of war, and reckoned that some country would pay
handsomely for the sole rights to their machine.</p>

<p>Upon coming into touch with Governments,
they found the French most interested. The French War
Department, in fact, sent an agent to America to see
the brothers; and this agent, on his return to France,
reported favourably upon the invention. But experimenters
were now nearing success in France, and the
Wrights would consider nothing but a large cash payment;
so negotiations fell through.</p>

<p>During the next two years, practically nothing
was heard of the Wrights. They were, as a matter of fact,
still perfecting their machine, still negotiating for its
sale; but they declined to come into the open and show
what their craft would do. There was method, of
course, in this attitude; they aimed for one definite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
goal&mdash;that being a large sum as a reward for their labours.
But there is no doubt that precious time was lost. Had
the Wrights been able to place confidence in some agent
or manager, he would have acted for them and advised
them; their position would have been strengthened and
vital years would not have slipped away. They were
ready, as we have seen, to fly long distances in 1905;
and yet it was not until 1908 that, persuaded at last to
emerge from their seclusion, they demonstrated effectually
what their machine could do. But others had been
busy during those wasted years; and, when the Wrights
did appear, their triumph was not so sweeping as it might
have been. Other men, in fact, could fly; and though
neither they, nor their machines, represented the skill
and progress of the Wrights, still they had flown; and
this, at anyrate in the public mind, depreciated the
performance of the two Americans. Had the Wrights come
forward when no one else could fly, they would have
been hailed as unchallenged conquerors of the air; but
as it was, they were recognised only as being a certain
distance ahead of their French rivals.</p>

<p>Progress in France, though many inventors
were at work, had been slow. The Wrights, in fact, by the
sureness of their methods, had far outstripped those
Frenchmen who had followed up the problem at
Lilienthal&#8217;s death. Yet French experiments moved
along the same path as had those of the Wrights. First there
had come tests to find wing-curves; then the flying of gliders.

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 39.</span>&mdash;Voisin
Glider on the river Seine.</p>
</div>

<p>In the launching of gliders, some French
experimenters showed ingenuity. The brothers Voisin, for
instance, who played a prominent part in the early tests
in France, adopted the plan illustrated in <a href="#Fig_38">Fig. 38</a>.
The gilder was towed by a motor-car across an open stretch
of ground; then, when its speed was sufficient for the
planes to lift, it rose and flew behind the car like a kite.
Another form of glider, seen in <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>, was mounted
upon hollow wooden floats&mdash;anticipating the sea-plane
of to-day&mdash;and towed upon the river Seine by a motor-boat.
This gilder also, when its speed became sufficient,
rose into the air. In the construction of the machine, a
biplane, one notes resemblances to the method of the
Wrights; and yet generally the craft is dissimilar.
There are, of course, the two main-planes&mdash;characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of all machines of this type. Projecting in front of the
planes, also, there is an elevator on the same principle
as that of the Wrights. But between the main-planes
are fixed four upright planes, or curtains as they were
called. These were to preserve sideway balance, and
prevent the machine from rolling when in flight. Should
the craft tend to heel over, the surfaces of these planes&mdash;acting
sideways upon the air&mdash;resisted such a movement.
No wing-warping, such as the Wrights used, was fitted
to this glider; the vertical planes alone were relied upon
for sideway balance. The tail of the machine was a
reproduction of the main-planes on a smaller scale, having
two horizontal and three vertical surfaces. The theory
of these rear-planes was that of the balancing tail such
as is fitted to a kite; they steadied the machine
automatically when in the air, and checked any tendency to dive.</p>

<p>In 1905 a glider of this type was tested
on the Seine; but it was not until 1906, at a time when the
Wright aeroplane was capable of long flights, that a real
French success was obtained; and then the flights made
were brief, and carried out with a craft that was
admittedly crude. It was a biplane of curious construction,
built by the Voisin brothers for M. Santos-Dumont&mdash;a
rich Brazilian who had spent money freely upon
airships, and had been occupied, for some time before
the Voisins made him this machine, with a craft having
propellers to lift it vertically from the ground. Abandoning
this idea, he devoted himself to the machine the
Voisins built, which is seen in <a href="#Fig_40">Fig. 40</a>.
Here are the same box-kite main-planes, with vertical curtains
between them, as shown in the illustration of the Voisin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
glider. But now, to give the machine more sideway stability,
these main-planes are tilted up at a pronounced dihedral angle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_40" id="Fig_40"></a>
  <img src="images/figure40.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="242" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;Santos-Dumont&#8217;s Biplane which flew at
Bagetelle.</p>
</div>

<p>A curious feature of the machine was the large
box-kite elevator, set in front of the main-planes. This, as
can be seen in the figure is tilted down&mdash;the position it
would occupy were the craft descending from a flight.
The machine, it should be mentioned, flew with its
elevator forward, there being no tail behind the main-planes.
This elevator played a double part; it was
intended not only to make the machine rise and descend,
but also&mdash;by means of its side surfaces&mdash;to increase its
stability when in flight.</p>

<p>Following on lines upon which French inventors
had worked, the craft was fitted with light bicycle wheels,
and upon these it was intended it should run, until its
speed was sufficient for the planes to lift. This plan, of
course, had an advantage over the starting-rail of the
Wrights, seeing that a craft so equipped could re-ascend
from a spot at which it might alight without having to
be transported on a trolley to its rail&mdash;as was the case
with the Wright machine. But there was this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
disadvantage of the wheel system of launching; in order
to obtain a running speed, sufficient for the planes to
lift, the craft had to be fitted with a powerful motor.
In the Santos-Dumont biplane, an engine of 50 h.p. was
used, and even then the machine appeared under-powered.
But this was not so much the fault of the engine as of
the machine; it was heavy, and inefficient.</p>

<p>From July to October 1906, Santos-Dumont was
experimenting with this biplane, using a stretch of grass-land
at Bagetelle. Then, having the motor well tuned,
he gave notice to the French Aero Club that he would
make a flight on 23rd October. The Club&#8217;s officials
came together, and after some hours delay, owing to
unexpected trouble with the engine, the pilot said he
would attempt a flight. At 4.45 p.m. his machine ran
forward across the ground, driven by its two-bladed
propeller; then rose gradually, foot by foot, and flew
very low for a distance of about 80 yards. Almost
immediately it left ground the craft began to roll from
side to side, showing that its equilibrium was faulty;
and this roll became so pronounced that the pilot
switched off his motor and made rather a heavy landing,
breaking the gear beneath his planes. How the
biplane appeared when in flight is shown on <a href="#PLATE_II">Plate II.</a></p>

<p>The damage, however, was soon repaired, and
some alterations made to the machine; and on 12th November
Santos-Dumont flew 160 yards, and then 230 yards.
These flights made a sensation, particularly in view of
the fact that, although the Wrights had surpassed them,
the stories of their trials were thought exaggerated.
But Santos-Dumont did not follow up his success with
sufficient patience. Instead of seeking to perfect his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
machine, he soon abandoned it, and turned his attention
to a craft that should move upon the water before rising
into the air.</p>

<p>But the Voisins, not discouraged by the failure
of an experimental craft, soon had another in hand. It was a
biplane, with a front elevating-plane and a box-kite
balancing tail, and ran on wheels as the other machine
had done, being driven also by a 50-h.p. motor.
This craft, early in 1907, was acquired by M. Leon
Delagrange, a sculptor who had taken interest in
aviation. Transported to Vincennes, it was tested on
28th February, M. Charles Voisin being the pilot. But
the under-carriage proved too light, collapsing while the
machine was running upon the ground. At Bagatelle,
later, having in the meantime been improved, the craft
was again upon trial; but this time its sideway stability
was found to be faulty, and there was another delay.
Then on 30th March the machine flew for a distance of
60 yards. But Delagrange, like Santos-Dumont, did
nor persevere; he abandoned this machine in order to
carry out a new series of tests. While he was so engaged
M. Henri Farman came into touch with the Voisins,
and acquired a biplane which was practically identical
with that Delagrange had used. Farman was a man of
the same mould as the Wrights&mdash;quiet, persevering,
determined to succeed; and succeed he did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br /> <small>RIVAL AIRMEN</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Henri Farman flies, and wins £2000&mdash;Delagrange
and Bleriot&mdash;The Wrights emerge from their obscurity&mdash;Wilbur&#8217;s triumph in
France&mdash;The flights of December 1908.</p>

<p>Henri Farman, who was to achieve fame as a
pilot, was in many respects an ideal man for the task he had
in hand. Small, light, quick, with a sure eye for
distances and speed, and a sound knowledge of engines,
he had won renown as a driver of racing motor-cars
before turning to aviation. As soon as he obtained
delivery of his Voisin, he had it taken to the military
parade ground at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris; and here he
built a shed to house it, and began systematically to learn to fly.</p>

<p>For a month he was content to run the biplane
up and down the ground, accustoming himself to its controls
and tuning up the motor&mdash;which in early machines was
so apt to prove refractory. Exceedingly light, and
running at very high speeds, these first aviation motors
tended to become over-heated or break some working
part. But Farman, although he had more than his
share of engine trouble, was persevering; and on 30th
September 1907 he was rewarded by a flight of 90 yards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
This he increased to 100 and then 150 yards; but
now he found his elevating-plane was not in adjustment,
and this caused delay. By the middle of
October, however, he had flown a distance of 311 yards&mdash;beating
Santos-Dumont&#8217;s record of the year before;
and on 27th October, still improving, he flew 843 yards.</p>

<p>Now all eyes turned to Issy, and crowds
came to watch the airman in his tests. Progressing steadily,
and with uninterrupted success, Farman was ready at
the beginning of 1908 to bid for a £2000 prize which
had been offered under the following conditions: The
aeroplane was to fly across a line 50 yards in length,
marked out across the ground; to fly straight ahead for
540 yards; to circle a flagstaff without touching ground;
and then to fly back again to its starting-point, and pass
above the line. This flight, it will be seen, necessitated
a half-circle in the air; and the making of such a turn
was for some time Farman&#8217;s difficulty. His biplane
was heavy, and its engine would only just keep it in
the air; and when he came to turn, the machine lost
speed a little and&mdash;seeing that it flew low&mdash;showed
a tendency to touch ground. But Farman was always
successful in tuning up his engine, and on 13th January
1908 he made the out-and-home flight without difficulty,
and won the £2000 prize. A photograph of him in
flight in his biplane is seen on <a href="#PLATE_III">Plate III.</a></p>

<p>Here was one definite rival for the Wrights,
and soon they had another. Delagrange, coming again to the
Voisins after Farman had won this prize, obtained
another biplane, and flew with it on 14th March for
a distance of 328 yards. Then on 11th April, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
become more proficient, he made a circular flight of
2&frac12; miles, following this by a flight in which he remained
aloft for 18 minutes 30 seconds. Farman, gaining
skill from day to day, managed to fly for 19 minutes without
descending, and then took up a passenger for short flights.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet another aviator, soon to become well
known, had now begun to fly; this was M. Louis Bleriot, a
maker of motor-car head-lights, who spent money and
risked his life in the testing of monoplane machines.
Some of these experimental craft had two main wings;
others four&mdash;one of the latter being illustrated in <a href="#Fig_41">Fig. 41</a>.
An interesting feature of this machine was the use of narrow,
pivoted planes at the extremities of the front main-planes,
which could be swung up and down to control sideway balance.
With a craft of this type, after many failures, Bleriot
began to make short flights. Then the machine was
wrecked; but Bleriot, indomitable as Farman and the Wrights, soon
built another; and with this he flew for 8 minutes 24 seconds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile&mdash;what of the Wrights? Their
interests had, at last, been placed in the hands of a syndicate;
and to this syndicate it became obvious, as one after
another of the French successes was chronicled, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
some definite display should be made. The Wrights
possessed an aeroplane at this time which, in controllability
and efficiency, was far in advance of any French
machine; but the need was to demonstrate this. So it
was arranged that, while Orville Wright remained in
America, and flew in a series of tests before the military
authorities, Wilbur should take a biplane to France and
challenge the Frenchmen on their own ground&mdash;or
rather in their own air.</p>

<p>Wilbur&#8217;s first experiences in France were not
pleasant. His machine, to begin with, made an unfavourable
impression. In comparison with the ingenious, scrupulously-neat
construction of the French engineers, it
appeared clumsy and amateurish. The brothers had
not, in fact, wasted any time upon the finish of their
machines. They were sufficiently strong, and they
knew that they would fly. Beyond this they did not
concern themselves, disdaining all perfections of woodwork
or of detail. The Wright engine, when contrasted
with the specially-lighted, beautifully-constructed French
motors, was a heavy piece of machinery which could
have been rendered more efficient in several ways. But
the Wrights understood their motor, and would use no other.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Wilbur Wright said little; made no
boasts or idle claims. Putting his machine together at Le Mans, where
he had come to make his trials, he flew on 8th August
1908 for 1 minute 45 seconds, during which he rose
about 40 feet high and made two circles in the air. He
would have flown longer, but his motor was not working
well. On 13th August he was in the air for 8 minutes
13 seconds. This he improved upon by a flight, on 5th
September, of 19 minutes 48 seconds; and on 21st
September, feeling greater confidence in his machine,
he flew for 1 hour 31 minutes 25 seconds.</p>

  <p class="center">PLATE V.&mdash;BLERIOT LEAVING THE FRENCH COAST.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below1">
Rising from Les Baraques, near Calais, on the memorable flight
to Dover, Bleriot passed over the sand-hills at the brink of the
Channel, and steered out boldly across the water, his monoplane
receding quickly until it was a speck in the sky.</p>
</div>

<p>He had now rendered of small account the successes
of his rivals. But it was not so much the length of time
he remained in the air, as the control he had over his
machine, which impressed those who saw his tests. The
French aeroplanes had, up to this time, flown sluggishly
and with no certainty in their movement. They rose,
and that was all; they were barely controllable; they
flew falteringly, and caused anxiety in the minds of
those who saw them aloft. But with Wilbur Wright
there was none of this. His biplane rose smoothly from
its rail and soared here and there, absolutely under
control, and responsive instantly to its pilot&#8217;s levers&mdash;climbing,
sinking, wheeling, and diving, with a swift ease
and precision that won the admiration of all.</p>

<p>After his hour&#8217;s flight in September, Wilbur
undertook the teaching of two pupils to fly&mdash;the Comte de
Lambert and M. Tissandier. With the former as a
passenger he flew for seven minutes, and then took up
M. Tissandier for eleven minutes. These flights, however,
he eclipsed on 3rd October, when he flew with a
newspaper correspondent for fifty-five minutes; and on
the next day, seeking to improve upon this, he remained
in the air with another passenger for 1 hour 4 minutes 26 seconds.</p>

<p>Such flights were, at the time, quite beyond the
capacity of French machines, and Wilbur Wright&mdash;appearing
so unassumingly upon the scene&mdash;had everything
in his hands. Farman, however, was not inactive
Practising now at Chalons, and having his motor well in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
tune, he decided to attempt a cross-country flight&mdash;the
first in aerial history. Rising from his test-ground at
Chalons, he attained a height of 130 feet, and flew a
distance of 17 miles to Rheims, passing above rows of
poplar trees and being twenty minutes on his journey.
This feat, as showing the reliability of the aeroplane,
was greeted with acclamation.</p>

<p>A point against the Wright machine&mdash;which was
criticised by experts in spite of its success&mdash;was the fact
that it could ascend only from its starting-rail. This, it
was said, made it less practicable than the machines of
the French builders&mdash;which were, as explained, constructed
so that they would run on wheels. Point was
lent to this criticism on 31st October 1908, by a feat of
M. Bleriot. Using a new monoplane&mdash;the eighth he
had built&mdash;he said he would fly from Toury to Arteney
and back, a distance of about 19 miles, alighting when
he reached Arteney and then ascending again. This
programme he carried out. Eleven minutes after leaving
Toury he reached Arteney, and then had to descend
rather hurriedly owing to a defect in his magneto. This
took an hour and a half to repair; then the airman set
off on his return flight to Toury. But he had flown only
3 miles when his magneto again gave trouble, and he
had to glide to the ground, alighting safely upon an open
stretch of land. After a few minutes delay he rose
again, and this time reached his starting-point without
mishap. Such a cross-country journey as this, with two
halts, would not have been practicable with the Wright
machine; that is to say, had it descended in a field
owing to engine trouble, and at some distance from its
starting-point, it would have been necessary either to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
take it back by road to its launching apparatus or bring
this gear to the field in which it lay. The starting
system of the Wrights, although excellent in its way,
and making for efficiency and low engine-power, had
the drawback of limiting the use of the machine to an
aerodrome; or, should the pilot attempt a cross-country
flight, he knew he must return to his starting-point without
alighting, or run the risk of being stranded at some
distant point, and having to dismantle his machine. It
is not surprising, therefore, that the launching rail fell
into disfavour. No one used it except the Wrights, and
in later models of their machine even they abandoned the system,
and fitted craft with running wheels and more powerful motors.</p>

<p>Wilbur Wright, although he made no effort
to compete with Farman or Bleriot in cross-country flying,
achieved remarkable flights in the last month of
1908. Two prizes were on offer&mdash;one for the longest
flight of the year, the other for the greatest height
attained. Making an attempt to win the former on
18th December, he flew for 99 kilometres (61 miles)
round a triangular course, his time in the air being
1 hour 53 minutes 59 seconds. This feat dwarfed all
those of his rivals; and, in another flight on the same
day, he showed still further the superiority of his machine.
Ascending in an attempt for the height prize, he reached
an altitude of 377 feet.</p>

<p>Not content with these flights, and fearing
some opponent might beat him at the eleventh hour, Wilbur
ascended again on 31st December. Flying steadily
round a course marked by flags, he remained in the air
from early in the afternoon until sunset, having covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a distance of 76&frac12; miles and being aloft for
2 hours 20 minutes 23 seconds.</p>

<p>So the year ended. The Wrights, coming late
upon the scene, had proved that their machine, save for the
limitation of its starting rail, was the most efficient in
existence, and far ahead of those of the Frenchmen.
One serious accident, however, marred the Wrights&#8217;
triumph. Orville, after excellent flights in America, was
carrying a military officer as passenger when a chain
driving a propeller broke in mid-air. The biplane passed
beyond control and fell, and the officer, Lieutenant
Selfridge, was killed&mdash;the first victim of an aeroplane
disaster. Orville sustained a broken thigh.

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Crossing the Channel by air&mdash;Contest of three

British pioneers.</p>

<p>Up to this time the public, reading of the flights
of the first airmen, had not realised what these flights meant.
They had not grasped the significance of the aeroplane;
its possibilities as a weapon of war; its use as a vehicle
for passing from place to place&mdash;high in the air, at great
speed, and with an ability to soar above land or sea,
mountains or woods, hills or valleys. But they were no
longer to remain in doubt. The year 1908, as shown,
closed in rivalry between several airmen, and with a
flight lasting more than two hours. In 1909, the most
memorable year in the history of the conquest, these
feats sank into insignificance, and the world began to understand
what was being done, and what flying would mean in peace and war.

</div>

<p>At the beginning of 1909 there were two types
of successful aeroplane&mdash;the Wright and the Voisin.
Bleriot had flown with his monoplane and flown well;
but he was still in the process of evolving a practical
machine, and several other inventors were in a similar
stage. It was the Wright and the Voisin which had
proved their worth; and the Wright, as has been said,
was the better of the two. Of the Voisin, as flown in
1909, a reproduction is given in <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>.
It was a heavier aeroplane than the Wrights&#8217;, owing largely to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the weight of its alighting gear (250 lbs.) and of its big
balancing tail (more than 100 lbs.); hence the necessity
for using a 50-h.p. motor, which drove a two-bladed
metal propeller at the rate of 1200 revolutions a minute.
The Voisin brothers, and other French makers, did not
approve of the two-propeller system of the Wrights:
they preferred one screw, revolving at high speed. But
there was no doubt&mdash;at any rate in this stage of aviation&mdash;that
the Wright method was more efficient than that
of the Frenchmen. It was calculated, indeed, that the
Wright biplane, when actually in the air, could be driven
at an expenditure of only 15 h.p.; whereas the Voisin,
even with its 50-h.p. motor running at full speed, had
only just enough power to fly.</p>

<p>There were in 1909 two memorable events, and
both impressed the public with the progress of aviation. One
was the crossing of the English Channel by aeroplane;
the other the flying meeting&mdash;the first of its kind in the
world&mdash;which was held upon the plain of Betheny, near
Rheims. To be first to cross the channel by air was
the ambition of more than one of the rivals; and the
flight was rendered attractive by a prize of £1000,
offered by the London <i>Daily Mail</i>. Preparing to
attempt the feat, early in the summer of 1909, were
three competitors, the names of two of whom are familiar.
One was the Comte de Lambert; he, it will be remembered,
was Wilbur Wright&#8217;s pupil. Now an accomplished
airman, he had a Wright biplane at Wissant on the
French coast. Another competitor was M. Bleriot,
whose early exploits have been chronicled. The monoplane
he had now evolved was an ingenious craft, and
merits careful description. Its main features may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
seen in <a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>. The machine was remarkable chiefly
for its smallness and lightness. While the Voisin biplane
weighed just upon 1000 lbs., the weight of Bleriot&#8217;s
monoplane was only 484 lbs. The span of its main wings
was not more than 28 feet, and they contained only 150
square feet of lifting surface. Driving the
machine was a motor of 25 horse-power; and the propeller,
being placed at the bow, was what is known as a &#8220;tractor.&#8221;
Instead of pushing the machine, as in the case of the Wright
and the Voisin, this propeller drew the monoplane through the air.</p>

</div>

<p>Sitting within the body of his machine, at a point between
the main wings and level with their rear edges, Bleriot controlled his craft
by a simple mechanism. His feet rested upon a pivoted
bar; this, by a movement of either foot, operated the
rudder at the rear of the machine. In front of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
pilot was an upright lever, which he grasped with
both hands. At the bottom of it, attached to a bell-shaped
piece of metal, were four controlling wires, two
running to the wings and two towards the tail.
Those fixed to the wings caused the rear edges of
the planes, which were flexible, to move up and down.
A side-to-side action of the lever, which drew upon
the wires and caused the wings to warp, prevented
the monoplane from rolling while in flight. The
Wrights, it may be recalled, adopted a similar method,
although their system of leverage was different. A
forward or backward movement of this same lever
controlled the rising or descending of the monoplane.
Its elevating-planes, instead of being at the front of the
machine, as in a biplane, formed part of the tail. This
tail was one narrow, horizontal plane, with a section at
either end working up or down upon a pivoted rod.
When the hand-lever was drawn back, the elevating-planes
were tilted, and the monoplane rose. A reverse
movement was used for descent.</p>

<p>Chief interest, at the early stages of the race
to be first across the Channel, was centred in a newcomer&mdash;Mr.
Hubert Latham. He was a young man of leisure,
whose family, formerly an English one, had settled in
France. Being fond of sport, and particularly of the
shooting of big game, he had been attracted to flying
through the medium of some balloon ascents.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1909 a new monoplane made
its appearance in France&mdash;a powerful, finely constructed,
and very stable machine. It was the Antoinette, designed
by a famous engineer, and it was this craft which
interested Latham. M. Levavasseur was the designer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
of it and of a specially lightened motor, first applied to
motor-boats, and afterwards to the experimental biplane
of M. Santos-Dumont and also to the aeroplane with
which Farman first flew. The Antoinette, which M.
Levavasseur also fitted with one of his motors, was a
large monoplane&mdash;far larger than the Bleriot; and built
not with the idea of being a fair-weather machine, but
to fly in winds. The craft is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>.
The span of its wings was 46 feet, and they contained 365 square
feet of sustaining surface, while the total weight was 1040 lbs.</p>

<p>The monoplane, in its method of control, differed
from other machines. Upon either side of the pilot, as
he sat in the tapering, boat-shaped body, was a hand-wheel.
One operated the elevating plane; the other
controlled the warping of the wings; while to steer from
side to side the airman pushed pedals at his feet, and so
swung the rudder at the stern.</p>

<p>Driven by its 50-h.p. Antoinette motor, the
monoplane showed itself capable of flying well; but it found
no successful pilot until Latham took it in hand. He
associated himself financially with its constructors, and
went to Mourmelon in France to learn to fly the machine,
and his skill became evident. On 5th June he flew for
1 hour 7 minutes without alighting, and afterwards made
flights in wind and rain. Latham was slight of figure
and deft in movement, had a cool, quiet judgment, and
was courageous sometimes to the point of being reckless.</p>

<p>After his success at Mourmelon, it was decided
to attempt the cross-Channel flight; and the monoplane
was transferred to a temporary shed at Sangatte, a few
miles from Calais. First on the scene, Latham was
ready for flight early in July; but the weather proved
unfavourable. There was fog in the Channel and he
had to wait. In the meantime&mdash;on 13th July&mdash;Bleriot
made a cross-country flight of 25 miles; then he, too,
packed up his monoplane and dispatched it to Calais.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
On the morning of 19th July, there being little
wind and practically no fog, Latham said he would attempt
the crossing. Rising from the slope of a hill a little way
inland, he passed out over the cliffs and steered for
Dover&mdash;a torpedo-boat destroyer, placed at his disposal
by the French Government, following him across Channel,
so as to be ready to pick him up should he make an
involuntary descent into the water. It was fortunate this
vessel did steam upon his track. When he had reached
a point not quite half-way between the French and
English coasts, flying 1000 feet high, Latham&#8217;s motor
began to miss-fire; then, without further warning, it
stopped altogether. There was only one thing to do,
and the airman did it. Piloting his machine in a slanting
glide, he alighted upon the surface of the water.
Fortunately there was no high sea, and the monoplane
floated with its wings flat upon the water. Tucking up
his feet to avoid getting them wet, Latham lit a cigarette
and waited for the destroyer, the captain of which had
seen his fall and came steaming at full speed. How the
machine appeared, as it lay in the water, is shown in the
photograph on <a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV.</a></p>

<p>So much damage was done to the monoplane in
retrieving it from the sea, that it was practically destroyed,
and Latham was left without a machine, with his rival
Bleriot now upon the scene. But the Antoinette Company,
having a craft in reserve at Rheims, decided that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
this should be hurried to the coast, and Latham given the
opportunity of making another attempt. This second
machine was telegraphed for, accordingly, and assembled
with all speed, and on the morning of 25th July both
Latham and Bleriot were ready for flight. Farther
down the coast at Wissant was the Comte de Lambert;
he had met with an accident, however. In testing his
biplane he side-slipped near the ground and the machine
was wrecked; this spelt delay while he was procuring
and tuning another craft.</p>

<p>On 25th July, a Sunday, there was a stiff
breeze soon after it became light, and nobody imagined that
flying would take place. Bleriot, however, motored
from Calais to the spot where his monoplane was
housed, and after a short trial flight, during which his
motor ran well, said he should attempt the Channel
crossing. Latham had not then left his hotel.</p>

<p>There was a dramatic moment before Bleriot
started his engine. Standing up in his machine and peering
over the Channel, he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where <i>is</i> Dover?&#8221;</p>

<p>A friend stretched out an arm, pointing across
the water, and the airman nodded and sat back in his machine.</p>

<p>Rising in a half-circle to pass above some telegraph
wires, Bleriot sped out across the water&mdash;as shown on
<a href="#PLATE_V">Plate V</a>&mdash;and his machine receded until it
was a speck. He flew low and the wind was strong enough to bring
white crests to the waves. This wind, furthermore, was
seen momentarily to be rising, and anxiety was expressed.
In a few minutes, to those watching from the French
coast, the monoplane and its pursuing destroyer passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
out of sight. And then came a period of waiting,
crowds gathering about the wireless telegraph station
which, installed temporarily on the cliffs, was in touch
with Dover. And while his friends waited thus in
suspense, the lonely airman fought a rising wind&mdash;poised
perilously above the waves, and with no sign of
land either before him or behind. Those on the torpedo-destroyer,
although she was steaming fast, lost sight of
the airman before mid-Channel was reached. He had
said that, should he out-distance this vessel, he would
circle in the air and wait till she overtook him, so as to
have the certainty of being picked up should his engine
fail. But when in actual flight, although he saw his
escort left far behind, Bleriot did not swing round and
wait, but instead bore swiftly on; and his reason for so
doing was this: the wind was rising steadily and he
reckoned his only hope of reaching the English shore
was to fly straight on, and seek to make a landing before
the gusts became too violent.</p>

<p class="space-below2">For ten minutes, in this historic flight,
Bleriot flew through a sea-fog, seeing nothing above or below him,
and with instinct only to guide him upon his course.
Had his motor stopped then, causing him to plane into
the sea, his position would have been almost hopeless.
It is true that in the body of his monoplane had been
placed an air-bag, to help it float should he alight upon
the water; but even with such buoyancy it is doubtful
whether the machine would have withstood the buffetings
of the waves for more than a few minutes; and
Bleriot himself was handicapped by the fact that, as the
result of the igniting of some petrol a week or so before,
he had a burned foot which made him limp painfully. But his
motor did not falter&mdash;although, in this cross-Channel flight,
the airman was asking it to run longer than it had done before.

  <p class="center">PLATE VI.&mdash;BLERIOT REACHES DOVER.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below1">
Wind-tossed and exhausted, after his flight from Calais, the airman
planed down near Dover Castle; descending so abruptly, owing to the
gusts, that he broke his running-gear and propeller. He is seen above
in his overalls, a few minutes after landing&mdash;a crowd having already
gathered on the scene.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
Passing from sea-mist into open sky, Bleriot saw the
English coast-line; but it was not Dover that lay before
him, but a point considerably north-east of it; and he
realised that, as he had flown across the water with
no landmark to guide his eye, he had been borne off
his course by the pressure of a south-westerly wind.
Holding on till he came within planing distance of
the shore, he turned his craft towards Dover; but
the wind, which he was now facing, seemed to gain
in strength. The monoplane pitched and swayed and
made little headway, and the pilot became anxious as
to his landing. It had been arranged that he should
alight upon the Shakespeare Cliff; but now, approaching
Dover upon the side opposite to this cliff, he decided
to land somewhere without a moment&#8217;s delay, and not
wait until he gained the farther point. So he turned
suddenly towards an opening in the cliffs which lay
below Dover Castle. Descending in passing above the
land, he met the full brunt of the gusts as they played
over the cliff. The monoplane was caught and twirled
completely round; and the airman straightened it only
to be tossed again like a leaf before the wind. A second
time he regained control, and once more his machine was
flung from its course. But now, being well over the
land, and with an open stretch of grass below him, he
planed steeply down. The landing was abrupt&mdash;in
fact, made with desperate haste; and the chassis of
the machine was broken by the shock and the propeller
splintered. But Bleriot was not concerned at this. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
clambered stiffly from his seat, the great flight done;
and soon motor-cars came, and he was carried in triumph
to the town. The scene upon the cliff, showing the
monoplane a few minutes after it had landed, with
Bleriot being interviewed by a journalist, is seen on
<a href="#PLATE_VI">Plate VI</a>. The course the airman flew in crossing the
Channel is indicated by <a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>.</p>

when flying the Channel.</p>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the French shore, the news was
received by wireless; and so overjoyed was M. Anzani, the
builder of Bleriot&#8217;s motor, that he suddenly burst into
tears. One of those who stood waiting for a message was
Latham; and when the word came that Bleriot had
made the flight and won the prize, he took off his cap
and cried, &#8220;Bravo!&#8221; Then he ordered his mechanics
to bring out his machine, saying that, although there
was nothing to be won, he intended to make the crossing
to show what his machine could do. But when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
reached the starting-point the wind had risen and was
blowing in heavy gusts; whereupon, although he seemed
determined to fly, M. Levavasseur and others persuaded
him that the idea was hopeless.</p>

<p>In two days&#8217; time, however, his chance came.
Upon a fine, perfectly calm evening he started upon a second
crossing, and this time flew fast and well. The watchers
at Dover saw him approach&mdash;saw him reach a point
within little more than a mile of the Admiralty pier.
And then, just as it had done before, his motor broke
down and he had to plane into the sea. But this time,
failing to make a smooth contact with the water, he was
thrown forward from his seat against a wooden upright,
cutting his head badly and sustaining shock. Picked
up by a motor-boat he was brought into Dover; then,
after a doctor had attended him, he returned to France.
Again his monoplane was wrecked in its recovery from
the water. The Antoinette Company had fared badly
in this contest, losing two machines and having their
chief pilot injured. The Comte de Lambert, after
hearing of Bleriot&#8217;s success, did not attempt a flight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Henri Farman had played no part in this
cross-Channel flying; he was busy with the tests of a biplane
of his own construction. In July, at Rheims, there was
to be the great flying meeting; and Farman had made
up his mind to wait for this. Aided by the experience
he had gained with the Voisin machine, he had designed
a craft which should be generally more efficient and
faster in flight, and more quickly responsive to its
controls. The biplane he produced, marking as it did
a step forward in construction, is a machine that needs
description. The general appearance of the craft is
indicated by <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>, while an illustration of this type of
machine in flight will be found on <a href="#PLATE_VII">Plate VII</a>. A feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of the Voisin that Farman discarded was the vertical panel
fitted between the main-planes to give sideway stability.
An objection to these planes was that they added to the
weight of the machine and checked its speed, tending
also to drive it from its course should there be a side
wind. But in taking away such fixed balancing-planes,
Farman had to substitute another device; and what he
did was to work upon the same theory as the Wrights
had done, and obtain a similar result in a different way.
They, it will be remembered, had warped the rear
portions of their main-planes. Farman kept his planes
rigid, but fitted to their rear extremities four narrow,
hinged planes, or flaps, which could be moved up and
down and were called ailerons. Their effect was the
same as with the Wright wing-warp. When a gust
tilted the machine, the pilot drew down the ailerons
upon the side that was inclined downward; whereupon
the air-pressure, acting upon the drawn-down surfaces,
restored the machine to an even keel.</p>

</div>

<p>The control was simple. At the pilot&#8217;s right
hand there was a lever; this, when moved forward or backward,
operated the elevating-plane; and a sideway
action controlled the ailerons. At the pilot&#8217;s feet was a
pivoted rod, and this, as he pressed upon it with one
foot or the other, swung the twin rudders at the tail.</p>

<p>Such a system of hand-and-foot control has
become general in aeroplanes. The pilot uses as a rule
a hand-lever or wheel for governing the ascent or
descent of his craft, and for sideway balancing, and
employs his feet for operating the rudder. This leaves him a
hand free for the manipulation of his engine throttle and switch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-below2">A feature of Farman&#8217;s biplane was the
landing gear, as shown in <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>. It comprised
two long skids, which projected in front of the main-planes beneath
the machine, and continued some distance rearward; while
mounted upon each of these skids, at a point below the
front edge of the lower main-plane, was a short metal
axle which bore two small bicycle wheels, fitted with
pneumatic tyres. Holding the axle to the skid were
thick india-rubber bands, and the working of this
apparatus was as follows: when the machine moved
across the ground, the bicycle wheels bore its weight,
and the skids were prevented from making contact with
the surface. But when alighting from a flight, should
the biplane strike ground heavily, then the wheels were
pushed up by the yielding of the elastic bands, and the
skids took the shock of the impact. Light, and with no
complications, this form of gear proved remarkably
efficient; and by degrees it came to be used, not only
in the Farman, but upon other types as well. The
necessity in any such device was lightness; when the
machine was in the air, and until it landed from its
flight, the alighting gear was so much dead weight&mdash;and
not only this, but the air-pressure on struts and stays acted
as a check upon the speed of the machine. Any landing
gear to be useful and efficient, therefore, must be light
and yet strong, and have few parts which can offer
resistance to the air.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Farman planned to win prizes at the Rheims flying
meeting, and he succeeded. But the flights he made
would hardly have been possible had not he obtained
the use of a new motor&mdash;one destined to play a vital
part in the development of flying. This was the Gnome;
and to understand its triumph an explanation is necessary.
Before Farman fitted the first of these motors to his
biplane, engines in aeroplanes had been troublesome and
unreliable. The difficulty was that they must be very
light, and yet capable of running at high speeds and
under heavy loads. Working, say, at 1000 revolutions
a minute or even more, they drove the propeller of an
aeroplane at full speed for the whole of the time it was
in the air, and enjoyed no occasional rest, or slackening
of power, as was the case with motor-car engines on
the road. The result was that, being light and experimental&mdash;and
at the same time so heavily worked&mdash;they either broke small but
vital parts, such as a valve or connecting-rod, or became
over-heated and failed to deliver their power.</p>

<p>To prevent overheating, there were two
cooling systems available. In one, known as water-cooling,
a stream of water flowed through metal chambers round
the cylinders, and tended to reduce their heat. But
this implied extra weight, and the carrying also of a
radiator, or framework of thin pipes exposed to the air,
through which the water was pumped, so as to cool it
after it had passed round the heated cylinders. The
second system, which obviated the use of water or
radiators, was known as air-cooling. In this the tops
of the cylinders were ringed with metal flanges, or fins,
upon which the air impinged as the machine flew. This
method is adopted in most motor-cycle engines, and
answers admirably. But with aeroplane motors, in the
early days, the high speed at which they worked, and
the fact that they obtained no rest in flight, or slackening
in the number of their revolutions, made them overheat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
very often, in spite of their cooling fins. One might
liken their work to taking a motor-cycle and running it
at top speed up a hill without end.</p>

<div class="figleft">

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 47.</span>&mdash;The seven-cylinder<br />50-h.p. Gnome motor.</p>
</div>

<p>The difficulty with air-cooling&mdash;although
it had obvious advantages over water-cooling&mdash;was to
bring enough air to play upon the surfaces of the
cylinders; and it was here that the Gnome won so
complete a success. In other engines the cylinders
were stationary, and their pistons, moving up and down
in the cylinders, turned a crank-shaft to the end of which the
propeller was fixed. Therefore the only air the cylinders
obtained was what rushed upon them through the speed of the machine
in flight. But in the Gnome, instead of the cylinders remaining
stationary and the crank-shaft revolving, the
cylinders themselves spun round, and the crank-shaft did not move.
An illustration of this motor with one end of the crank-chamber
removed, so that the piston-rods can be seen, is given
in <a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a>. It will be noted that there are
seven cylinders, set in the form of a star, and that the seven
piston-rods projecting from them come together upon a
single crank-pin, which is attached to the stationary
crank-shaft and turns round it. The propeller, instead
of being fitted to the crank-shaft, as was the case with
other motors, was bolted to a plate upon the engine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
itself, so that when this turned around its crank-shaft,
it carried the propeller with it.</p>

<p>A difficulty in this engine lay in feeding
its cylinders with their petrol and air. We showed, in
<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>, how this mixture is delivered to
an ordinary motor, which has its cylinder stationary. But with
the Gnome the mixture could not be supplied from
a pipe to the cylinder-head, for the reason that the
cylinder was revolving. The problem was solved by
making the stationary crank-shaft hollow, and by
delivering the mixture through this to the interior in
the engine; thence it was sucked into the cylinder-heads
through a valve in the pistons. There were
other complications, inevitable to this ingenious motor,
which led critics to declare it would prove unreliable.
But their judgment was wrong, for by making every
working part with scrupulous care, and sparing no
expense in the quality of the materials used, the
builders of the Gnome did render it reliable. They
achieved another triumph as well; they eliminated
overheating. Revolving more than 1000 times a
minute, the cylinders of the Gnome cooled themselves
automatically, and the engine proved that it would
run for hours without becoming too hot, or the
pistons seizing in the cylinders. Furthermore, seeing
that the weight of water and of radiators was avoided,
the Gnome was remarkably light. The 50-h.p. engine
weighed no more than 165 lbs., which meant that it
gave one h.p. of energy for each 3.3 lbs. of its weight.
A photograph of the Gnome, as fitted to a Farman
biplane, is seen on <a href="#PLATE_VIII">Plate VIII</a>.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The Gnome, when first built, was regarded with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
scepticism. Farman, however, showed the acuteness
of his judgment. He obtained a Gnome and fitted
it to the biplane which he flew at Rheims; and the
wisdom of this choice was soon made clear. The chief
prize at Rheims was for the longest flight, and this
Farman won easily, remaining in the air for 3 hrs.
4 mins. and covering a distance of about 112 miles.
The flight represented a world&#8217;s record; and by this
feat alone Farman made his biplane famous, and
demonstrated the reliability of the Gnome. Those who
watched the flight will not forget it. Farman started
rather late in the afternoon and flew low round the
great aerodrome, his landing-wheels appearing sometimes
to be a few feet only above the grass. He
sat leaning forward in his seat and circled close to
the wooden towers marking the course, losing no
ground and steering his machine with perfect accuracy.
So he flew for lap after lap, never rising higher or
flying lower, and with the Gnome behind him emitting
a booming hum as it whirled the propeller without
falter or flag. Only the approach of darkness, in fact,
caused the airman to descend.

<p class="space-below2">Of famous aeroplanes at Rheims, five
types stood out by themselves&mdash;the Farman, the Voisin, the Wright,
the Bleriot, and the Antoinette, all of which have
been described. But there was one other, which few
people had heard of before it appeared here. This
was the Curtiss biplane, built by an American named
Glenn H. Curtiss, and engined with a motor which also
bore his name. Curtiss had experimented with many
power-driven machines&mdash;motor-cycles, motor-cars, airships,
and aeroplanes&mdash;and had won a prize in America
with a small, light biplane, and it was a craft of this type&mdash;as
seen in <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a>&mdash;that he brought with him
to Rheims, his idea being to compete for the speed prize. The
machine had a front elevator and tail-planes, according to
the practice in biplane construction; but an innovation
was the setting of the ailerons midway between the main-planes&mdash;a
position that will be noted in the sketch; another novelty was
the way these ailerons operated. At the pilot&#8217;s back, as he sat
in his driving seat, was an upright rod with two shoulder-pieces&mdash;by
means of which, should he shift his body, he could swing the rod
from side to side. Wires ran from the rod to the ailerons; and
if the pilot leaned over, say, to the right, he
drew down the ailerons on the left side of the machine.
The merit of such a control was that it was instinctive;
that is to say, should the biplane tip down on one side, it
was natural for the pilot to lean away from the plane-ends
that were sinking; and he operated the ailerons automatically,
as he did this, and so brought the machine level
again. This ingenious system is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Features of the Curtiss biplane were its
smallness and lightness. The span of its main-planes was only
28 feet 9 inches&mdash;no more than the span of the Bleriot;
and it weighed, with its pilot on board, a total of only
710 lbs. Driving the machine was an 8-cylindered
30-h.p. motor; therefore it was expected to be fast
in flight. The speed contest, as a matter of fact,
became a duel between Curtiss&mdash;who flew his machine
himself&mdash;and Bleriot, who piloted his fastest monoplane;
and in the end Curtiss won, attaining a speed of a little
more than 47 miles an hour. Bleriot had built for the
contest a new racing monoplane, which had a motor of
80 h.p., and in which the pilot sat below the wings.
The photograph on <a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX</a> shows the
appearance of this type of craft.</p>

<p>Latham, in his Antoinette, won the height
prize at Rheims, rising to an altitude of 500 feet. Others
who distinguished themselves were Paulhan and
Rougier, on Voisin biplanes&mdash;the former to become
famous afterwards as the winner of the <i>Daily Mail</i>
£10,000 prize for the flight from London to Manchester.
But the Voisins, although they flew steadily,
seemed slow, clumsy machines in comparison with the
Farman. The Wright biplanes, of which there were
three in competition, did not distinguish themselves
particularly. The pilots who had charge of them, and
had been taught to fly by Wilbur Wright, were the
Comte de Lambert and M. Tissandier, who have been
mentioned already, and M. Lefevre&mdash;a pilot who was
the first to make trick flights, wheeling, diving, and
swinging in circles, and astonishing people who watched
him from the stands. Not long after the Rheims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
meeting, while testing a new machine, this airman met
with an accident that proved fatal, his craft diving
suddenly and being wrecked.</p>

<p>The Wright machines, to tell the truth,
were not regarded favourably in France. Many men were
attracted by the speed and simplicity of the monoplane;
many others, again, championed the Farman with its
Gnome. The chain-drive of the Wright propellers
was said to be a source of danger, and their need to
start from a rail was, in view of the wheeled under-carriages
of the French machines, declared a clumsy
makeshift. So, although the machine was the first power-driven
craft to fly successfully, and despite the feats of
Wilbur in 1908, the Wright biplane did not conquer
France. Although they had lagged behind the Wrights
in the building of practicable machines, the enthusiasm
of French makers soon carried them ahead of their
rivals. The Wrights handicapped themselves; they
would not, for a long time, discard the starting-rail;
they would not adopt the Gnome motor; they were
averse from making alterations in the construction of
their machine. So their biplane, although its efficiency
was always granted, never took the place to which it
seemed entitled.</p>

<p class="space-below1">It was after the Rheims meeting that the
building of aeroplanes commenced as an industry. Farman established
a factory and began to produce biplanes in considerable
numbers; Bleriot had received orders for
monoplanes after the cross-Channel flight; and the
Voisins were building too. There were French firms,
also, who had been given permission to manufacture
the Wright biplane; and in England, at a factory in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the Isle of Sheppey, Messrs. Short Brothers were
building Wright machines.</p>

</div>

<p>It is necessary now to consider the growth
of flying in England. While mighty deeds were done in
America and France, there had been pioneers at work
here&mdash;painstaking and enthusiastic, but handicapped
sadly by the public indifference that prevailed. They
met with no encouragement&mdash;no financial help; they
had to build their machines as best they could, and
whether they succeeded or failed seemed the concern of
none. An experimenter who braved this apathy and
won his way until he became a constructor of aircraft, was
Mr. A. V. Roe. For some time he was an advocate of
the triplane form of machine&mdash;a craft, that is to say,
with three main-planes fitted one above another. The
machine with which he obtained flights, although they
were very brief, is seen in <a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>.
Subsequently, however, Mr. Roe adopted the biplane form. His
distinction in the pioneer days was that he managed
to make his triplane lift into the air and fly a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
distance, with the aid of a motor-cycle engine developing
no more than 9 h.p.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Another ardent worker in England, and
one destined to become famous, was Mr. S. F. Cody. After developing
a system of man-lifting kites which the British War
Office acquired, he joined the military aircraft factory
that had been established at Farnborough. Here, after
tests with dirigible balloons, he began the construction
of experimental biplanes&mdash;all machines of large size.
Early in 1909 he made brief flights&mdash;the longest being
one of about 250 yards. Then, after alterations to his
machine, he managed in July to fly a distance of 4 miles.
This he increased afterwards to 8 miles; and then on
1st September flew for 1 hour 3 minutes, rising to a
height of 300 feet. Cody&#8217;s biplane was a very large
machine, having 1000 square feet of lifting surface&mdash;twice
that of the Farman or Voisin. Driving it was an
80-h.p. engine, which operated two propellers on the
system used by the Wrights. With its pilot on board
the machine weighed 2170 lbs. It is illustrated in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>.</p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span>&mdash;The Cody Biplane.</p>
</div>

<p>In the control of the machine Cody introduced
original devices, notably as to sideway balance. Instead
of using ailerons or wing-warping, he arranged his two
elevating-planes so that they would move up and down
independently of each other. In this way, by making
one tilt up and the other down, he was able to obtain
the same effect as with ailerons. When raised or lowered
in unison, these planes acted as elevators. Cody
managed also to combine all controlling movements in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
one lever, and did not use his feet for steering. Before
him, as he sat in his driving seat, he had a rod which
ended in a hand-wheel. Pushed forward or backward,
this rod moved the elevating-planes; swung over from
side to side, it altered the angle of one or other of the
elevating-planes and so controlled sideway balance;
while by turning the wheel at the top of the rod, the
pilot could operate the rudder at the rear of the machine.
Cody made little progress until he obtained a powerful
motor, his machine being too large and heavy for the
engines fitted to other craft. Acquiring a motor of
120 h.p. in 1912, he won the War Office competition on
Salisbury Plain, his biplane showing its superiority&mdash;as
a purely military craft&mdash;even over those of the famous
French builders. It was in the summer of 1913, while
flying a new machine, that the airman and a passenger
fell to their death&mdash;expert evidence showing that the
craft collapsed in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Two other Englishmen prominent in the early days
of aviation were the Hon. C. S. Rolls and Mr. J. T.
C. Moore-Brabazon. The former, having learned to
glide as the Wrights had done, obtained a British-built
Wright biplane and made excellent flights at
Shellbeach, Isle of Sheppey. During the season of
1912, still piloting a Wright, he took part in several
aviation meetings; and it was at Bournemouth, owing
to the collapse of a tail-plane, that he fell 90 feet and was
almost instantly killed. Towards the end of 1909, Mr.
Moore-Brabazon, after buying and learning to pilot a
Voisin, ordered a British-built biplane from Messrs.
Short Brothers, and with this machine on 30th October
1909 he won a £1000 prize offered by <i>The Daily Mail</i>
for the first circular mile flight by a British aviator upon
an all-British machine.</p>

<p>Now indeed, once the first obstacles had been
overcome, the building of aeroplanes and the training of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
men progressed astonishingly. New champions appeared
almost every day; many aviation meetings were held;
and Henri Farman, to complete the triumphs of a
wonderful year, flew in November for 4 hours 17 minutes
35 seconds, covering a distance of 150 miles through the
air, and breaking all records for duration of flight.

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br /> <small>PERILS OF THE AIR</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">How pilots fought the wind&mdash;Military demands
for an &#8220;airworthy&#8221; machine&mdash;Value of the air-scout&mdash;Dangers in
wind-flying&mdash;The &#8220;side-slip&#8221;&mdash;Aeroplanes that are automatically stable.</p>

<p>It has been shown how aeroplanes were built
and made to fly, and not machines of one particular make, but
biplanes and monoplanes of various types of construction;
also how, granted he had a reliable motor, a man
might fly for hours without alighting. These were the
lessons of 1909; these, and the fact that flying was
proved an art that could be learned by any man who
was active and had sound nerves. After Wilbur Wright
had taught his first pupils, and Bleriot and Farman had
established training schools, men in rapidly increasing
numbers came to learn to fly; so that, quite early in
1910, it was possible to list the names of more than 200 pilots.</p>

<p>Progress was now revealed in two directions:
firstly, encouraged by engine reliability, airmen made cross-country
flights; and secondly, becoming more used to
being in the air, and gaining confidence in the handling
of their machines, they began to fly in gusty winds.
This was shown by the fact that, fearing any breeze at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
first that was higher than 10 or 15 miles an hour, pilots
soon combated winds of 20 and 25 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Flights of 100 miles were made across country;
one historic example, of course, was M. Paulhan&#8217;s 183-mile
journey from London to Manchester, made in 242
minutes and with but one halt, by which he won <i>The
Daily Mail</i> £10,000 prize, and in which&mdash;meeting him
in keen but friendly rivalry as the representative of England&mdash;he
had the joint author of this book, Mr. Claude Grahame-White.</p>

<p>The confidence of pilots in the reliability
of their machines was demonstrated conclusively by the Comte
de Lambert. Rising from the aerodrome at Juvisy, near
Paris, he flew over the city and circled the Eiffel Tower,
returning afterwards without accident to his starting-point.</p>

<p>Several more airmen had, by this time, succeeded
in crossing the Channel, and a notable feat was that of the
Hon. C. S. Rolls, who flew from Dover till he reached
the French coast near Calais; then, circling without a
descent, he returned to his starting-point&mdash;a flight over-sea
that lasted an hour and a half. In high flying, too,
the confidence of airmen was displayed. At Rheims
in 1909, it may be remembered, Latham rose 500 feet,
and this was considered remarkable. But the record,
during 1910, was beaten and beaten again, until it stood
at nearly 10,000 feet. In speed also, using monoplanes
with 50-h.p. motors, pilots made records day by day;
and an English airman, Mr. Radley, flying over a
measured course in August 1910, in a Bleriot monoplane,
attained a speed of more than 70 miles an hour.</p>

<p class="space-below1">In the duration of flight, which proved the
reliability of engines, great strides also were made. From Farman&#8217;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
4-hour record at the end of 1909, the figure was carried till
it stood at 6 hours 1 minute 35 seconds. This flight was
made by Tabuteau, an airman flying a Maurice Farman
biplane. Maurice was a brother of the famous Henri,
and he built a biplane which, while resembling the
Henri Farman in general aspect, was different in detail.
In the first machines he built,&mdash;and it is one of these
the sketch (<a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a>) shows,&mdash;Maurice Farman
used, in addition to ailerons, two side curtains or panels, as the
Voisins had done; but these he afterwards abandoned,
retaining ailerons alone. A feature of this machine was
the way in which the landing skids were continued
upward, so as to form the supports for the elevating-plane.
The Maurice Farman developed into a stable
and remarkably successful craft, greatly used for cross-country
flying and by military pilots.</p>

<p>The chief triumph of 1910 was the fight
airmen waged against the wind. This was their enemy&mdash;an
enemy which sought to chain them to the ground, and
prevent their craft from becoming of practical use. One
point, indeed, became clear: it was of little value to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
fly high or for long distances, if one could only do so in
favourable weather. The aeroplane, if it was to play a
practical part in the affairs of the world, must ascend in
high winds as well as in calms. This being recognised,
there was strenuous effort to produce an &#8220;all-weather&#8221;
machine. Particularly was wind-flying of value in the
military use of aeroplanes; and it is here that we reach
a vital aspect of aviation. Immediately craft could fly
across country, and ascend high enough for a view of
the land to be obtained from them, it was seen they would
have a great value as scouts in time of war.</p>

<p>There has, from the earliest days of battle,
been a need for scouting&mdash;a need for news as to what the
enemy is doing. Picture two armies about to engage.
They approach each other cautiously, troops spread out
and dotted here and there; while in front of each force
is thrown a screen of outposts. These form a protective
fence, through which the scouts of the enemy find it difficult
to penetrate. What the scouts seek to discover is
how many men there are in the army moving forward, how
many guns, and how these men and guns are being
massed and drawn up for the battle that impends. But
the outposts head them off and shoot them down; and
as both armies have outposts, and as both sets of scouts
find the same difficulty in obtaining news, the two forces
may grope and blunder into battle without knowing such
facts as to numbers and positions as might spell the
difference between victory and defeat. Of course, the
scouts do their best, some on foot, some horsed; but it
was Napoleon who wrote:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;Nothing is more contradictory, nothing more bewildering,
than the multitude reports of spies or of officers sent out to
reconnoitre. Some locate army corps where they have seen
only detachments; others see only detachments where they
ought to have seen army corps.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now came the aeroplane, and strategists
seized the opportunities it offered. Outposts could do nothing
against such a scout as this; instead of seeking to dodge
them through a wood, or round a hill, it could pass
thousands of feet above their heads; and the earth
below, as viewed by the spy sitting in his machine,
would be spread out like a panorama; he would see the
troops of the enemy in motion, and note their strength
and the positions to which they moved. No wonder
the War Departments of Europe were ready to buy aeroplanes.
Buy them they did, indeed, in growing numbers;
but the drawback of the early machines was that they
were fair-weather craft; they would not fly in winds.
Imagine that a battle impends, and that the Commander-in-Chief
of one army seeks news as to the movements of
some division of his enemy; so he orders the air-scouts
to ascend. But the wind may be blowing hard; and if
it is, and the aeroplanes are only fair-weather machines,
they will have to remain on the ground till the wind
drops, and perhaps miss their greatest chance during a
whole campaign.</p>

<p class="space-below2">But it was astonishing how, feeling
greater confidence in the handling of their machines, airmen began
to join issue with this enemy the wind. They were helped, too,
by a growing efficiency in the construction of their craft.
Machines were built more strongly, engines were more
staunchly made; in all details that spelt reliability, were
aircraft improved. But the wind, none the less, took its
toll. It was not combated without loss of life; and we
find that, before the end of 1910, nearly thirty men had
been killed while flying. In many cases, struck by a
heavy gust, a machine collapsed in flight; in others,
beaten over by the force of the wind, but with his craft
intact, the pilot had fallen to earth, powerless to regain
the control of his machine.</p>

This type of monoplane, in which Mr. Grahame-White learned to
fly&mdash;being seen with a passenger above&mdash;was built by Bleriot for
the speed contests at Rheims in 1909. It had an 80-h.p. motor,
as compared with the 25-h.p. engine which was then fitted to ordinary
Bleriots, and attained a speed of 60 miles an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
In wind-flying there were these two distinct
dangers: a man might be dashed to earth by a gust when rising
or descending; or he might be struck by a rush of wind
when at a considerable height, and find his craft driven
over until it began to slip sideways instead of flying
forward. In &#8220;side-slips,&#8221; as they are called, there lies
a grave risk. What happens is this. A man flying in
a wind may, by vigorous use of his ailerons, recover the
balance of his machine time after time; but as the wind
rises, he may be struck ultimately by a gust that tilts his
planes to an abnormal angle, despite his efforts to check
them. The machine will then heel till it stands almost
vertical&mdash;till it reaches such an angle, in fact, that it
ceases to move forward and begins to slip sideways&mdash;skidding
away, beyond the pilot&#8217;s control, like a motor
on a greasy road. How an abnormal gust may cause a
side-slip is illustrated by <a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>.</p>

<p>In such a predicament, two things only can
save the airman; one his height above the ground, the other his
nerve and presence of mind. If he is flying low when
his machine side-slips, nothing can avert disaster. Falling
at first sideways in a helpless lurch, then diving violently,
the craft will strike ground with shattering force&mdash;completely
beyond its pilot&#8217;s control. But if the airman
is flying high, and granted he is a man of experience, he
may escape even the worst of side-slips, and how he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
does so is as follows: as his machine slips he puts
forward his elevating-lever as far as it will go, throws
over his rudder to help the action of the elevator, and
sets his motor at its fullest power&mdash;these actions seeming,
in themselves, merely to aggravate the peril by causing
the craft to fall more quickly. But the pilot knows what
he is doing; he knows that, so long as his craft slips sideways,
it is impossible for his controlling planes to act,
seeing that they are effective only when
the machine moves forward through
the air. What he seeks to do, therefore,
is to convert the side-slip into a
forward dive. If he can do this&mdash;if he
has space for the man&#339;uvre before the
machine strikes ground&mdash;he knows he can avert disaster.</p>

<p>In throwing over his elevating-lever, and accelerating
his motor, his aim would be to make his machine fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
forward more rapidly than it is slipping sideways;
and, as a rule, under the combined thrust of the motor,
and the extreme angles of elevating-plane and rudder,
the craft will&mdash;after a sickening slip, perhaps of several
hundred feet&mdash;begin to lose its sideway motion and
plunge straight downward. His elevating plane will
then become operative, tending to check this dive and
bring up the bow of the machine; and at the same time,
feeling he has regained control, the pilot will throttle
down his motor so as to reduce the speed of his machine.
In this way, responding to the action of its elevator, the
craft will pause in its downward rush, and sweep
forward again upon an even keel. But the actions of
the pilot, in such a quandary, need to be accurately and
boldly made; and unless his craft flies high, no skill can
save it. If he has not a thousand feet or more below
him, he will be dashed to death before his man&#339;uvre
has time to take effect.</p>

<p>The moral, therefore, lay in flying high,
and it was one that pilots respected. Instead of passing across
country at a few hundred feet, they began soon to ascend
3000 feet and more; and at such altitudes, apart from
the greater safety in case of side-slip, an airman found
usually a steadier and less gusty wind, and was in a
better position to choose some landing-point should his
motor fail suddenly.</p>

<p>When starting across country, particularly
in the early days, a pilot had to consider very seriously the
question of the failing of his motor. So long as he had
an aerodrome below him, its smooth surface providing
an alighting spot, he felt no great concern. But in
flying across country, should his motor stop, he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
find himself above a forest, or a sheet of water, or such
rough and broken land that his machine would be
damaged were he to alight upon it. But here again,
as in the case of side-slip, altitude would tend to safety.</p>

<p>In the stoppage of its motor, when a craft
is in flight, several factors need consideration; but one should clearly
be understood: even if his engine does fail while he is
passing through the air, a pilot is not helpless, nor
does his machine fall to the ground. As he flies, of
course, it is the thrust of his motor, acting through the
medium of the propeller, that keeps his craft moving
forward; and so long as this thrust is there, forcing his
planes against the air and causing them to lift their load,
the machine will fly ahead. But what happens should
the engine fail, and the machine cease to be propelled?
The first effect is that the craft begins to lose its speed,
and as it does this its planes are less operative. Unless
he can restore his forward speed, therefore, and so
maintain the lift of his planes, the pilot is in peril. Were
he merely to sit still after his engine failed, and do
nothing to save himself, he would be in a position of the
greatest risk. What would happen would be that his
craft, having no power thrusting it against the air, would
come gradually to a standstill; then, its planes exercising
no further lift, it would lose equilibrium and fall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-below1">But there is another force the airman can
use, even when his motor fails entirely; and this is the downward
pull of gravity, which acts unceasingly upon his machine.
He must, at all costs, restore the speed of his craft; not
only that its main-wings may bear their weight, but that
its controlling-planes may continue operative, and enable
him to steer towards a landing-point. What he does, therefore,
when he hears his motor stop, is to tilt his elevating
lever and send his machine upon a dive. Thus, even with no motor to
propel him, he can still fly. It is gravity now that moves his machine,
and so long as he keeps his lever forward, and sends his craft downward
upon a gradually sloping path, he has perfect control and need not
fear a fall. Air is still being forced under his planes; therefore,
they bear their load; and, seeing that the machine is moving forward,
its rudder and other controlling planes are able
to do their work. The airman is, in fact, as much in command of his
machine as he was before its motor stopped&mdash;save for one vital
difference. While his motor ran he could
fly where he pleased; but now he is obliged to glide downward. He is,
indeed, in the same position as was Lilienthal, or any of the men who
soared from hilltops. But, being say 1000 feet or more high when his
engine stops, he has the advantage of a long glide before he reaches
ground; and this gives him a chance, surveying the land below him, to
pick a smooth landing-point that may lie in his path.
If well-designed, an aeroplane will glide a long way after
its motor has failed, as is indicated by <a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>. In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
case, representing an actual test with a military machine,
the motor has stopped at an altitude of between 1200
and 1400 feet, and the craft glides, before touching
ground, a distance of nearly 9000 feet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_54" id="Fig_54"></a>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span>&mdash;The gliding angle of a plane.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below1">The motor is switched off at a height of between 1200 and 1400 feet,
and the craft glides nearly 9000 feet before landing.</p>
</div>

<p>This gliding without motive power is a
safeguard to the airman when he flies across country. Should he
attain a sufficient altitude, he has little to fear, even if
his engine does fail. As he glides down, he can steer
from side to side, or make a half circle and land upon
a spot that lies behind him. An aeroplane with a gliding
path of 1 foot in 10, and at a height of a mile when its
engine stopped, would glide ten miles before alighting.
Taking an extreme case, one might imagine an airman
flying over a city. Suddenly, while above a network
of streets and houses, his engine stops. But even in
such a quandary as this, granted he has the wisdom to
be several thousand feet high, he need not fear disaster.
Glancing keenly below him, he sights some park or
open space like an oasis among the close-packed
buildings, and glides swiftly and accurately towards
it, landing without difficulty or injury to his machine.</p>

<p>The making of a gliding descent, or <i>vol-plané</i>,
is an art all airmen learn; and the vital thing to remember
in connection with it is, that the machine must always
move swiftly forward. Sometimes, checking his glide
too soon, a pupil at the schools will make what is called
a &#8220;pancake&#8221; landing: that is to say, misjudging his
height above the ground, he stops the glide of his craft,
by a movement of the elevating plane, when he is still
15 or 20 feet in the air. The result is that the machine
comes to a standstill, then drops flat upon its wheels;
and in doing so it may break its chassis supports, and give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the pupil a shaking. The art, in a gliding descent, is to
lessen the steepness of the dive, by throwing up the
elevating plane only a second or so before the landing-wheels
make their contact with the ground. Then, its downward speed
checked&mdash;in the same way that a bird checks itself, just before its
feet touch earth&mdash;the wheels of the craft will meet the surface
smoothly, and there will be no shock or rebound.</p>

<p class="space-below1">In most cases, a machine with a good gliding angle
is regarded with favour; but there are circumstances&mdash;such,
for instance, as when a pilot seeks to alight in a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
field&mdash;when a gradual descending angle is a disadvantage.
The field may be bounded by trees; hence, if the machine
prolongs its glide, and he cannot make a quick landing,
the pilot may find himself threatened by a collision.
To check the forward glide of a craft, when necessary,
and bring it to earth at a steep angle, air brakes are now
being tested, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.
When not in use, they form sections of the lower main-plane, and
are operated by the pilot with a lever. Their action is simple:
pivoted in the centre, they swing until they expose themselves
at right angles; and their surface, when thus
exposed, tends very materially to check the glide. The
descent of a machine into a small field, with and without
brakes, is shown in <a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>; and from
this the value of the brake may be seen.</p>

<p>The chief peril of the air, when pilots
came to understand their risks, was seen to be this: that
a machine might be caught by a wind-gust when flying
near the ground, and dashed to earth before its pilot
could check the helpless dive; and this peril still presents
itself. Combating a breeze at first, then gusty
winds, the airman has so progressed to-day that he will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
face a 60-mile-an-hour gale. When well aloft, indeed,
he hardly cares how the wind may blow. It may turn
him completely over, but he is not lost; as shown by
&#8220;looping the loop,&#8221; in fact, a pilot can perform a
somersault in the air and not lose control of his machine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looping the loop,&#8221; which has made so great
a sensation, has taught airmen one definite lesson; and it
is this: no matter how their machines may be beaten
and tossed by the wind, they need not fear a fall&mdash;provided
they are high enough above ground. The movements
of a machine, as it makes a series of &#8220;loops,&#8221; are
shown in <a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>. The pilot reaches a
high speed before he rears up his machine to begin the &#8220;loop,&#8221;
and this downward velocity is attained by diving; then,
when he estimates his pace sufficient, he pulls his
elevating-lever back and the machine leaps upward,
rearing itself vertically towards the sky, turning over on
its back, then diving again and coming right-side-up&mdash;thus
achieving a complete somersault. A skilled trick-flyer,
also, will allow his machine to drop sideways or
tail first, deliberately working the controls so that it shall
do so. Then, just as it seems to spectators that he is
falling to destruction, he will dive or twist, regain the
mastery of his machine, and descend in a normal glide.</p>

<p>An airman, flying in a wind, is rather in the
position of a man who puts to sea in a small boat when waves are
high. Once he can clear the shore, the boatman feels
at ease; but should a breaker catch him before he
reaches the smooth, rolling billows a little distance from
the beach, his craft may be overturned and dashed to
pieces. So with the airman; his moments of peril, when
flying in a gusty wind, come just as he is soaring from the
ground, and when descending from a flight. Then an air-wave, like
a sea-wave, may lift his craft and drive it with a crash to earth.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
And there is the peril, when near the ground, of a
down-rush of wind caused by hills or woods. More than
once, when making a landing near trees, a pilot has found
his machine swept in a descending current. What
happens, in such a case, is that the wind curls over the
wood or hill that may form the obstruction, and sends a
strong eddy downward; should a machine be caught
in such a trend, it may be carried to earth, pell-mell,
before the pilot can check its dive. Again&mdash;as another
unseen danger&mdash;there are &#8220;holes in the air.&#8221; The
atmosphere is in constant movement, it must be remembered;
currents of warm air ascending and currents of
cold air descending; and sometimes, between a layer of
warm air and a layer of cold, there may be violent swirls
and eddies. An aeroplane may fly into such a disturbed
area and fall suddenly a distance of many feet, through
being caught and swept earthward in a rapidly descending current.</p>

<p>But such dangers, like others which threaten,
are being surely but steadily lessened. Machines are now
built and flown which, owing to the shape and angle of
their planes, have a stability which is almost automatic.
This means that, when flying in a wind, the pilot need
not be working incessantly at his levers. His machine,
once a suitable height has been reached, will fly with no
more control than a touch upon the rudder-bar. Apart
from questions of safety, such stability enables long
flights to be made without fatigue. Should he be flying
a machine which needs constant work at the controls,
and should the wind be high, a pilot becomes often so
exhausted that he is compelled to descend. An automatic

in <a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>. Its main-planes are swept back
in the shape of an arrow-head; the rear extremities of the top-plane,
forming large ailerons that are locked in position or
movable at the pilot&#8217;s will, are uptilted at their ends;
while the lower main-plane is given a dihedral or sloped-up
stabilising angle. The uptilted ailerons, which bring
a negative or top pressure to bear upon each wing-tip,
and the dihedral angle of the lower plane, which acts
in conjunction with them, produce an effect which checks
automatically any tendency to a sideway roll.</p>

<p>The arrow formation of the planes preserves
the stability of the machine in a fore-and-aft direction.
Should its pilot force it up at too steep an angle, it
will merely come to a halt in the air and then dive
forward and resume its normal flight; while, if it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
made to plunge too steeply downward, its bow will
rise automatically and the machine resume an even keel.</p>

<p>Another machine which is stable in flight, owing
to the peculiar formation of its wings, which resist a diving
or plunging movement, or a lateral swing, is the Dunne
biplane&mdash;as designed by Lieutenant J. W. Dunne.
This craft is seen in <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>. Using such
a machine, pilots have flown for long distances with the control
levers locked, the biplane adapting itself automatically
to the wind-gusts and preserving its equilibrium without
aid of any kind. It has neither fore-plane nor tail; it
is made to ascend by elevators which are in the form of
hinged flaps, or ailerons, and is steered by two rudders
at the extremities of the main-planes.</p>

<p>In the future, it is now clear, the automatically
stable aeroplane will play a highly important part.
Large machines, with duplicate engines, will be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
constructed that, beyond causing them to rise and
descend, and move to right or left, the steersman will
have nothing to do; to all wind-gusts and inequalities
in the air the machine will adapt itself automatically.
In this way it will be possible to build very large craft,
carrying a number of passengers or a consignment of
goods, and to fly in any winds save such raging gales
as drive ships for shelter into port.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <small>MILITARY AND CROSS-COUNTRY FLYING</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Aerial scouting&mdash;Types of machines
used&mdash;The high-speed monoplane&mdash;Steering across country&mdash;An
airman&#8217;s map and compass.</p>

<p>When they could fly in high winds, and their
motors were reliable, it was seen that aircraft would become
vital factors in time of war; so vital, indeed, that no army
or navy could afford to be without them. Successful
aeroplane builders, consequently, such as the brothers
Farman and Louis Bleriot, became busy with the construction
of military craft. France threw herself with
enthusiasm into the creation of an aerial fleet. Germany,
more methodical, studied cautiously and yet thoroughly
the problems involved; while in England, for several
years, the subject received scant attention.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1910, when one or two
aeroplanes were used in the man&#339;uvres in France, that
interest was first focussed upon their power as scouts.
These machines were not built specially for military
work, and there was little organisation or foresight in
their use; but observers accompanied the pilots upon
long cross-country flights, during which they hovered
above the enemy, and noted the location and movements
of troops. By being able to pass through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
air, and evade the enemy&#8217;s patrols, these observers
brought back news it would have been impossible to
obtain by use of cavalry scouts; and, owing to the speed
of their flight, they were able to glean such reports, and
fly back with them to headquarters, in a far shorter
time than would have been possible by any other means.
These first observers were officers, who sat behind the
pilots as passengers. They carried with them field-glasses
and notebooks, and the pilot obeyed their orders
as to the direction in which he should fly. Peering
down upon the land that lay below, an observer made
rough notes of all he saw; then, upon returning to his
starting-point, he prepared and handed in such a report
as is printed below:</p>

This report was one actually prepared, after an early
morning flight, by an officer-observer in the French
man&#339;uvres of 1910, and it shows how successfully an
air-scout may detect a movement of troops. The report
has an additional significance. Before he sent out his
aeroplanes, on this particular morning, the Commander-in-Chief
had assumed, but could not substantiate, the
theory that his opponent was retreating. And now this
report by aeroplane, showing that nothing save cavalry
and rear-guards had been seen over a specific tract of country,
served to confirm the rumour that the enemy was giving ground.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Once the value of aerial reconnaissance
had been proved, France proceeded to the development of a
scouting aeroplane; and the need, in such a machine,
is that the observer shall have a clear view ahead
and below. The construction of machines was, for this
reason, modified. The front elevating plane was moved
to the rear, where it was fitted in the form of a flap&mdash;as
in the case of monoplanes&mdash;and the pilot and observer
placed in a covered-in body, which projected in front of
the main-planes, as shown in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>. By
placing the body before the planes, the observer has a clear view
ahead and on either side; and even when he leans over the side,
and looks directly downward, there is no surface to obstruct him.

</div>

<p>This scouting biplane is intended for detailed
reconnaissance; for a careful flight above an enemy&#8217;s
position, that is to say, in which every movement of
troops is observed and noted. Another machine becomes
necessary for the making of a quick and general survey&mdash;such,
for instance, as that in which a pilot would be
asked to fly to some definite point, and see whether a
body of troops is stationary or on the march. Speed,
for such a task, is the chief requirement. Hence
there is a type of fast scouting monoplane, in which
a pilot can ascend alone, and fly at 100 miles an
hour. With such a craft, sweeping rapidly above an
enemy&#8217;s position, the pilot-observer can return with
his information at surprising speed. In <a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>
an air-scout of this type is seen. The tapering, covered-in
body will be observed; this is to reduce wind resistance
as the machine rushes through the air. The Gnome
engine is, for the same reason, covered by an aluminium
shield, which only allows the lower cylinders to project;
they must, of course, be exposed in some way to the air,
or they would not cool themselves. The landing-carriage
has been reduced to its simplest form; this,
again, is to reduce wind resistance; and the pilot, sitting
deep in the body, shows only his head as the machine
flies. Here, again, apart from the greater comfort in
being so shielded, the placing of the pilot within the
machine spells a lessening of pressure. This question
of the resistance of the air is vital in the designing of
high-speed craft. Every projecting surface must be
&#8220;stream-lined,&#8221; as it is called; it must, that is to say,
have such a tapering shape as will offer least resistance
as it passes through the air. The atmosphere is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
viscous&mdash;or, to use a commoner word, &#8220;sticky.&#8221; It clings
to anything that is passed quickly through it, as treacle
might adhere to the back of a knife; therefore the body
of an aeroplane&mdash;like the hull of an airship&mdash;slopes away
to a point astern, so that friction may be minimised.</p>

<p>What the pressure of the wind may mean,
when high speeds are reached, one may prove by holding a hand
from the window of an express, say while it is running
at 60 miles an hour. The rush is so fierce that the arm
will ache from the mere effort of holding it outstretched.
Whereas the train is running at 60 miles an hour, a
monoplane may be flying at more than 100 miles an
hour. Therefore the thrust of the wind against wires,
struts, and body may be imagined; it reaches the
violence of a hurricane. Even the pilot, glancing above
the wind-screen to steer his course, finds the pressure so
tremendous that, in some racing machines, he is provided
with a padded rest against which he can lean his head.</p>

<p>In the development of speed, some remarkable
craft are built. Each year there is an international air race
for the possession of the Gordon-Bennett trophy, and to
win this designers build special craft. In tiny monoplanes,
engines of high power are installed; and the
sustaining wings are so reduced, to give a maximum
speed, that the machines appear more like projectiles
than flying craft. A purely racing-type monoplane is
seen in <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>. It represents a Deperdussin,
which, with an engine of 160 horse-power, reached a speed of
130 miles an hour. How small this machine was, in
relation to its engine-power, will be realised from the fact
that the sustaining surface of its wings amounted to
only 104 square feet&mdash;far less lifting area, in fact, than
Lilienthal used in his gliders. Wires and struts are
reduced to a minimum; the body is tapered and
smoothed. Such a machine, although it carries speed
to an extreme, and is in reality a &#8220;freak,&#8221; teaches
useful lessons. But though it provides data for the construction
of high-speed scouts, a monoplane of this type would be
useless for cross-country flying; and for the reason that
it cannot be man&#339;uvred, prior to an ascent, upon anything
save the smoothest of ground. Its wings being so
small, to ensure a maximum of speed, the machine will
not rise until it has run forward a long distance across
the ground; and during this run it attains a speed of
nearly 90 miles an hour. At such a pace, unless the
ground below its wheels was level, it would leap, swerve,
and probably overturn. When alighting from a flight,
also, again owing to the smallness of its wings, the craft
has to plane down so fast that its pilot could not land
safely unless he had below him a surface that was absolutely smooth.

What is needed, in the high-speed machine, is a
power to vary its pace. If it will fly slowly, as well as
at high speed, landing difficulties are overcome; and as
a scouting machine it has the added advantage that,
should he be passing over a spot where he wishes to
make careful notes, the pilot can reduce his speed and so
gain leisure in which to survey. In the provision of variable
speed, aeroplane designers have achieved already
a striking success. By constructing a machine lightly,
increasing the efficiency of its planes, and reducing head
resistance to a minimum, and at the same time by fitting
an engine of ample horse-power, the modern builder has,
in some instances, produced a craft which will fly at 90

miles an hour as its high speed, and at 30 miles an hour
for a low, when its engine is throttled down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Contributing to this efficiency, there is the study
that has been made of the curve of planes. It will be
remembered that, according to early experiments, there
was a pressure below a cambered plane, and a vacuum or
lifting influence upon the top. The first students of
plane-curves reckoned that the pressure from below was
the more important of the two. But modern and
scientific research has shown that top suction is the
really powerful influence. It has been proved that the
upper part of a plane will yield a lifting effect which is
from three to five times as great as the pressure from
below. Hence, in the latest type of machine, the planes
are given two separate curves or cambers. The one on
the lower surface is designed to obtain a maximum up-thrust;
while on the upper surface the plane is so shaped
that, according to scientific research, it will extract the
strongest possible up-lift as it passes through the air.
The &#8220;hump&#8221; or arch, as advised by Phillips, is still
preserved; but in many cases it is less pronounced, and
is continued farther towards the rear of the plane.
What modern builders do is to design a wing-curve, and
then send it to a laboratory to be tested. Here it is put
in a wind tunnel&mdash;a tube through which a current of air
is driven by a fan&mdash;and its lifting influence tested by
instruments of precision.</p>

<p>The pilot slackens his speed when flying by
throttling down his motor, and so reducing the pull or thrust
of his propeller; or he sets his engine at full power, and
so attains his maximum speed. For military work such
variation is, as has been said, of great importance. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
air-scout needs to reach a given point quickly, and return
to headquarters at high speed. Every moment&#8217;s delay
in bringing the Commander-in-Chief some vital piece of
news, may spell the difference between victory or defeat.
It is here, in fact, that cavalry scouts have failed. They
may obtain important tidings, but before they can make
their way to headquarters and report, the aspect of
affairs has changed, perhaps, and their news&mdash;which
would have been valuable had it been received at once&mdash;has
lost its significance through delay. An air-scout
who can vary his speed will fly fast till he needs to
make an observation; then he will slow down and study
what lies below him; and, his survey completed, he will
return at top speed to headquarters.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy, for communicating between
an aeroplane in flight and its headquarters, is now adopted
for urgent reports&mdash;a cypher being used to prevent
messages being &#8220;tapped&#8221; by an enemy. At first poor
results were obtained, signals being audible on the
ground, when sent from a machine flying low, at a distance
of only about a mile. This was due to the difficulty
of producing a sufficiently light apparatus; but now, with
transmitting mechanism weighing from 70 to 80 lbs.,
messages may be dispatched from an aeroplane to a
land station 100 miles away, although problems still
remain to be solved in regard to the tapping and
jamming of signals. The dynamo generating the electric
current is driven by a small petrol motor, which develops
about 2&frac34; horse-power; and the antenna or aerial
wire, by means of which the message is sent forth&mdash;a
wave length of from 200 to 500 metres being adopted&mdash;may
be arranged between the planes and tail, or unwound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
from a reel below the landing chassis when a machine is
in flight, and allowed to trail earthward. Apparatus
weighing 20 lbs., is also being tested, by means of which&mdash;using
a magnifying receiver&mdash;an operator in an
aeroplane may receive a message as well as send one.
This allows communication, not only between a machine
and an earth-station, but also between two craft when in flight.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Another ingenious system of signalling,
from an aeroplane to its headquarters, when the former is flying
within view, is by means of smoke signals from the
exhaust of the engine. As the exhaust gases are shot
forth into the air they are rendered black by the mixing
with them of a powder, the admission of which to the
exhaust pipes the pilot can regulate by a lever. In
this way he is able to send black puffs of smoke into the
air, and spell out a message in the Morse code, which
an observer on the ground can read with field-glasses.
A more simple method, when an observer wishes to
communicate with those below, and yet avoid the delay
of a descent, is to drop a written message in a little bag,
to which a flag and a weight are attached. This is seen
as it falls, and is retrieved and carried to headquarters.

</div>

<p class="space-below1">A machine that has achieved success, owing
to its power of varying speed, is the Sopwith military biplane,
as shown in <a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>. Adopting a practice
that has become general, its wings are fitted upon what is
practically a monoplane body. Tail-planes and rudder
are the same as in a monoplane. The top main-plane,
as will be seen, is set slightly in advance of the lower.
The system is called &#8220;staggering&#8221;; and the idea is
that, by placing the upper plane ahead of the lower, the total
lifting power will be increased. It has been proved a
disadvantage of the biplane that, when the main-planes
are placed one above another, there is a slight loss of
lift owing to the fact that, acting upon the air as they do
quite close to each other, a certain amount of interference
occurs between them&mdash;one tending to disturb the
air-stream in which the other moves. By &#8220;staggering&#8221;
the two planes this interference is overcome; but some
makers regard it as a small consideration, and build their
planes in the ordinary way, allowing as large a gap as
possible between them. In the Sopwith military machine,
engine and propeller are in front of the main-planes;
then come the places for pilot and observer. The pilot
sits first, and the body of the machine is so high that
only his head appears above it, while just in front of his
face, to deflect the wind-rush from the propeller, there
is a raised section of the hull which acts as a screen.
Behind the pilot, sitting in a second opening in the hull,
is the observer. He has a view forward, rendered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
better by setting back the lower-plane; while at the
point at which it joins the body of the machine, immediately
below him, this plane is hollowed out, so that he
can look directly upon the earth below. Small windows
are also fitted upon either side of the hull. Through
those in front the pilot may glance when descending
from a flight, so as to judge his distance from the
ground, while the others are utilised by the observer, as
he turns to look from side to side. This biplane, and
many others, is balanced against sideway roll by ailerons,
and not by warping the wings. Constant warping, such
as is necessary in the everyday use of machines, has
been declared to strain a plane and render it weak;
therefore the use of ailerons is now favoured.</p>

The two sustaining wings, forming a single surface, are
raised above the body so that its occupants have nothing
to impede their view earthward; and they can also see
above them&mdash;an advantage of course in time of war,

<p>The driver of a modern-type aeroplane, sitting
snugly within its hull, has a wheel and instrument-board before
him, as sketched in <a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>. As he flies
across country he has many things to think of. Holding the
control-wheel in both hands, his feet resting upon the
rudder-bar, his eyes rove constantly among the instruments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
on the dashboard before him. He glances at the
compass often, for it is by this that he steers; and when
the air is clear, and the earth below plainly seen, he will
every now and then glance over the side of the hull, so
as to be on the look-out for a landmark that may tell
him he is on his course.</p>

<p>But sometimes, when the air is thick and misty,
or there are low-lying clouds and the earth is shrouded in a
fog, the pilot flies in an empty void. Nothing is to be
seen above, below, or on either hand; he must rely
entirely upon his instruments. The altitude meter tells
him whether he is rising or descending; his compass
tells him he is flying accurately to his goal; while his
own ear, and the tell-tale dial of the engine indicator,
informs him that his motor is doing its work. So
he sits within the hull of his craft, perhaps 5000 feet
above the earth&mdash;unseen by those below, and himself
seeing nothing of the land over which he flies. Should
the wind be steady, he has little to do save keep an eye
upon his instruments, and listen to the beat of his engine.
But if there are gusts and eddies his hand-wheel is busy;
each lurch must be corrected by a movement of the
ailerons, each dive checked by a pull upon the elevator.</p>

<p>The aeroplane compass, nowadays, has been
made accurate and reliable; but pioneers found it a dangerous
instrument. Vibrations from the engine, and the nearness
to the compass of such large masses of metal as the
motor and its fittings, made the needle deviate and give
false readings. Once, when upon a cross-Channel flight
and out of sight of land, a pilot glanced down at his
compass and saw that the needle, instead of pointing
northward, was spinning slowly round and round; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
so it continued until he had by guesswork groped his
way to land. But experience showed how a compass
may be mounted upon rubber shock-absorbers to guard
it against vibration; how fittings that are near it, such
as the steering-column and rudder-bar, can be made of
brass, or some other non-magnetic metal; while, as to
the attraction of the motor, the compass is corrected
against this by introducing scraps of metal into its case,
so that the needle can be drawn back to an accurate
reading from any deviation it may show.</p>

<p class="space-below2">But, even with an accurate compass,
the cross-country airman may have anxiety in his mind. He may be
flying in a side wind; and this, should it be strong and steady,
will have an insidious effect upon his path, tending
always to drift him sideways even while he keeps his
bow upon a compass course. <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a> should
make this clear. The airman seeks to fly from A to B, a distance
say of 60 miles; so he sets his course due east and
passes steadily across country at the rate of 60 miles an
hour, the bow of his machine always upon its compass
line. But while he is flying, a southerly wind blowing at
the rate of 20 miles an hour is pushing him sideways;
and, unless he corrects this leeway, he will find himself
after an hour&#8217;s flying, not at the point B, towards which
he imagined he had been making, but at C, 20 miles
north of the spot at which he had wished to alight.
The wind, blowing at 20 miles an hour across his course,
has pushed him these 20 miles to the north, although he
has steered accurately eastward.</p>

  <p class="center">PLATE XI.&mdash;AN AIRMAN&#8217;S POINT OF VIEW.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below1">
Sheets of water are excellent guides when flying. Trees show up
clearly, too; also roads&mdash;as may be seen from the one curving
at the extreme right of this photograph, which was taken from a
biplane piloted by Mr. Grahame-White.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-below2">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
When flying above land, the making of leeway may
be nothing more than an annoyance; but should the
pilot be passing above the sea, between coasts many
miles apart, this side sweep of the wind may be a peril.
One of the grim tragedies of aviation is attributed to
leeway in a wind. Leaving France on a flight to
England, Mr. Cecil Grace was driven from his course by
a wind which blew up Channel towards the North Sea.
There was fog, too; and as the pilot was using an early
type compass, it may have failed to register accurately.
At all events, he never reached the English shore. Seen
once while in flight&mdash;and this by a fishing-smack&mdash;he
was lost in the mist, flew wide of his course, and passed out
to the North Sea instead of towards the cliffs at Dover.
From that day to this his fate has been a mystery,
although it is true that not long after he vanished his
flying cap and goggles were washed upon the beach near
Ostend&mdash;mute but tragic witnesses to the ending of his
flight. But of the airman&#8217;s body, or of the wreckage of
his machine, nothing was ever found.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-below1">It is possible, with a modern-type
compass, to make an allowance for leeway. The airman studies a gauge
before he ascends, ascertaining the strength at which the
wind is blowing. Then he sets a pointer upon his
compass by which he may correct, even while passing
through the air, the sideway thrust of the wind; that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
to say, should he be flying to some point due east of his
starting-point, as was assumed in <a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>, and
should the wind&mdash;blowing from the south across his path&mdash;tend
to force him towards the north, then he would set
his pointer so that he was steering not due east, but to a
point a certain number of miles south of east. In this
way, with the wind driving him always north, he would
arrive not at the imaginary destination towards which
he steered, but at the real point due east which he
desired to make. The drawback of the method may be
this: should the pilot leave ground in a 10-mile-an-hour
wind, and should the strength of this wind increase say
to 20 miles an hour, his allowance for leeway would be
insufficient; but against this may be set the fact that the
airman, becoming aware probably, by the increased
rolling of his machine, that the wind was tending to
strengthen, would steer still wider of his goal. Compasses
are being tested, also, which allow pilots to make an
accurate and mechanical allowance, even while in flight,
for risings or fallings of a side wind. There is one, a
form of transparent compass, made so that the airman
can look down through it, and see the ground passing
away below. Selecting landmarks with his eye which
are a little distance apart, he is able to note&mdash;by contrasting
his compass-course with that his machine makes
when in relation with these objects&mdash;just how much drift
he should allow for. Then he alters his leeway
indicator and makes another observation later on, should
he think the wind has changed again.

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span>&mdash;An Airman&#8217;s Map.</p>
</div>

<p>Vital to the equipment of a pilot is his
map. In the infancy of flying, when airmen first began to
venture upon journeys between cities, they had neither
maps nor compasses, and contented themselves as a rule
with following a railway&mdash;the metals of which, gleaming
below and appearing as though ruled across the country,
provided an excellent guide. But soon, making longer
flights and passing perhaps over districts where there
were no railways, pilots found they needed a map; but
not an ordinary map, such as a tourist upon the earth
might use. Flying thousands of feet high, the airman&#8217;s
view of the land is bird-like. The country stretches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
away on all sides below, apparently almost flat, and
with its hills so dwarfed that they hardly catch the eye
(see Plates <a href="#PLATE_XI">XI</a> and <a href="#PLATE_XII">XII</a>).</p>

<p>A river, or a sheet of water, is a conspicuous
guide, and must figure plainly upon the airman&#8217;s map. Main
roads, too, are clearly seen&mdash;stretching like white ribbons
across the country. Railways also, and woods; while
churches, chimneys, and isolated buildings may be seen
from great distances when a voyager is in the air.</p>

<p>So the airman&#8217;s map is made up of landmarks that
are likely to catch his eye, remembering always his point of
view from above&mdash;and remembering also that as he
rushes through the air at a speed faster than an express
train, he needs to identify quickly any feature of the
landscape below. A sketch showing what an airman&#8217;s
map is like, will be seen in <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>.
Here we have railways, roads, rivers, lakes, and woods all
made to show plainly, and with a large building or chimney
indicated here and there. With such maps, and aided
by a compass, a pilot will fly for hours without losing
his way. When long flights are undertaken, and it
would be inconvenient for an airman to change from one
map section to another, he uses a narrow strip-map,
mounted upon a couple of rollers, and fitted in a case
with a transparent cover. As he passes across country
he unrolls his map, section by section, so that the
district he is traversing lies always before his eye.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <small>SEA-PLANES AND AIRSHIPS</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Biplanes and monoplanes with floats&mdash;A
flying boat&mdash;The airship&mdash;Its growth from the balloon and development
into types&mdash;Large craft with rigid hulls.</p>

<p>As military flying produces special forms of
aircraft, so the needs of the Navy make themselves felt; and the
first task set the designers of aeroplanes was to provide
a machine which should alight upon water. They did
so by fitting floats, or pontoons, below an ordinary land
aeroplane, these taking the place of the wheeled chassis;
and then by degrees a special type of air and water
craft was developed, and came to be known as the flying boat.</p>

<p class="space-below1">In <a href="#Fig_39">Fig. 39</a>, it may be
remembered, was illustrated a biplane which would rest on wooden
pontoons, and so ride upon the water; and this method of a hollow
float was adopted and improved by the modern builders.
In <a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a> will be seen a typical hydro-biplane,
water-plane, or sea-plane&mdash;the name last mentioned being that
adopted by our Admiralty when referring to such craft.
The machine is an Avro, and its appearance is that of a
land aeroplane, save that it has a set of three pontoons
to support it on the water&mdash;two main floats beneath the
sustaining planes, and a third to bear the weight of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
tail. Several needs have to be considered when such
floats are built. One is that they should be buoyant
enough to bear upon the water the weight of the
machine, and its pilot, passenger, and fuel. In the case
of the craft shown, this represents a total of 2200 lbs.
Another point is that the float should detach itself
readily from the surface of the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_68" id="Fig_68"></a>
  <img src="images/figure68.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="244" />
  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span>&mdash;An Avro Sea-Plane.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below2">A. Propeller; B. 100-h.p. Gnome motor,

seat; F. Rudder; G. Elevating-plane; H. Float to support tail;
I. Main floats to bear the weight of the machine.</p>
</div>

<p>The sea-plane, when a flight is made, is
launched upon the water down a slipway; then the pilot and
his passenger embark, the motor is started, and the
propeller draws the machine across the water at a rapidly
increasing pace. The floats raise themselves higher and
higher upon the water, as the air-planes exercise a
growing lift, until they only just skim the surface. And
now comes the moment when the airman, drawing back
his elevating lever, seeks to raise his craft from
the water into the air. At first only the front of the floats
rise, the rear sections clinging to the surface; then, in
another instant, the whole float frees itself from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
water in a scatter of spray, and the craft glides at a
gently-sloping angle into the air. It is the aim of
builders, by the curve they impart, to make the floats
leave the water with as little resistance as possible. In
the floats of the Avro (<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>) will be
noticed a notch, or cut-away section, which occurs at about the
centre of the float upon its lower side. This is called a
&#8220;step,&#8221; and is to help the float to lift from the
water. When the main-planes draw upward, as the craft moves
prior to its flight, the floats tend, as has been said, to
raise themselves in the water; and as they do so, lifting
first towards the bow, there comes a space between the
upward-cut &#8220;step&#8221; and the surface of the water. Into
this space air finds its way and, by helping still further
to free the float from the surface, aids greatly at the
moment when the pilot&mdash;operating his hand-lever&mdash;seeks
the final lift which will carry him aloft.</p>

<p>When in flight, as when skimming upon the
surface of the water, a sea-plane must carry its floats with
it; and this introduces a complication, inasmuch as the
floats offer a resistance to the air and tend to reduce
speed. Another need is thus shown; the builder of a
float must so shape it that it will move through the air
with the least possible friction. This is accomplished
by making it long and tapering in form and by curving
and polishing its surface.</p>

<p class="space-below1">England, in the building and handling
of sea-planes has come well to the fore, and our machines are
more advanced than those of other countries. The Admiralty
has recognised that, acting as a coastal scout in time of
war, such craft would be of the utmost value; thus we
find air-stations dotted round our seaboard, from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
machines may fly in a regular patrol. By the employment
of hundreds of craft, operating upon a well-ordered
plan, it will be possible in the future to girdle our shores
completely; and such machines would not only spy out
the approach of an enemy&#8217;s fleet, but give battle to hostile
aeroplanes or airships which might seek to pass inland.
The type of machine we have just described was a
biplane, but there are monoplane sea-craft, and a Bleriot
fitted for alighting upon the water is shown in <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span>&mdash;A
Bleriot Sea-plane.</p>
</div>

<p>Another form of craft is being developed
successfully&mdash;the flying boat. This is not merely a land
aeroplane with floats instead of wheels; it is a boat
with a sea-going hull, which has lifting planes upon
it; and it assumes the distinctive form seen in <a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>.
When on the surface of the water the machine floats like
a ship; then, when driven rapidly across the surface, its
planes raise it into the air and it flies. A closer view of
the hull of such a craft is given in <a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>.</p>

<p>Flying boats are at present small and lightly
built, and they have difficulty in weathering rough waves
when floating upon the water; but already the tendency
is to make them larger, and to give them more powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
motors, and such machines for naval work, as developed
in the future, may be as large as a torpedo-boat-destroyer
and capable of high speeds both on water and in the air.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-above2">There is another type of craft that is
being adapted and improved for naval use, and this is the airship.
Although it is costly to build, requires a huge shed in which
to house it, and needs also the service of trained crews to handle
it when ascending or alighting, the airship is a vastly important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
machine for the purposes of war. Its ability to make
flights lasting several days, and the power of its pilot
to man&#339;uvre it at night, render it particularly suitable
for naval use. Our Admiralty is buying large machines,
aiming at a preliminary fleet of fifteen, and the German
Navy is organising a squadron of Zeppelins.</p>

<p>The airship, although in use before the aeroplane,
has developed more slowly, and is even to-day in a crude
form. This has been due to the cost of experiments.
Whereas a new aeroplane may be built and tested for
£1000 or so, the construction of an airship and the
provision of its shed spells an expenditure of many
thousands. This money may, as in the case of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
aeroplane, be lost as a result of one mishap. In
Germany Count Zeppelin spent a fortune upon airships,
before the Government and the nation helped him with
funds. With very few exceptions, none but Governments&mdash;which
have long purses to draw upon&mdash;can afford to build large airships.</p>

<div class="figleft">

  <img src="images/figure72.jpg" alt="_" width="300" height="455" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span>&mdash;A modern Balloon.</p>
</div>

<p>The airship is a development of the balloon;
and the balloon we owe to Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier&mdash;two
French brothers who, after watching clouds floating in the
sky, had the notion that if they could fill a light
envelope with &#8220;some substance of a cloud-like nature&#8221;
it would raise itself into the air. Their father was a
paper manufacturer, and so they had facilities for making
a number of very large paper bags. Under these they
lit fires of chopped straw, allowing the hot air and
smoke to rush up into the bags, and, when they were
released the bags ascended, carried up by the lifting
influence of the heated air within them. Thus was
invented the hot-air balloon; and we buy paper replicas
of it to-day.</p>

<p>Delighted with their first success, the Montgolfiers
built a paper balloon 30 ft. in diameter, and this was sent up
at Annonay, in France, on 5th June 1783. It flew for
ten minutes before the heated air inside it became cold,
and reached a height estimated at more than a mile.
After this came the ascent of a spherical balloon&mdash;one,
that is to say, the shape of a modern-type balloon. It
was made of linen, covered with paper, and had a
small car attached. At Versailles, in France, on 19th
September 1783, this balloon was sent up with
passengers in the car; not human beings, though, for no
man cared to ascend, fearing that the upper atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
might have some strange effect upon him. The actual
occupants were a sheep, a cock, and a duck; and these
three unwilling voyagers made a flight which lasted
eight minutes. When they descended the sheep and
the duck were found to be unharmed, although greatly perturbed; but
the cock showed symptoms of not being well! At first, when learned
men examined him, it was thought the rarefied atmosphere had
in some way affected him, and this view was held until practical folk
were able to show that the bird had been trampled upon by the sheep.</p>

<p>From this, of course, the next step was the
ascent of a man, and on 15th October 1783 an adventurous youth
named Pilatre de Rozier went up in a balloon built by
the Montgolfiers. The balloon was attached to a rope
and not allowed to ascend more than 100 feet; and
at this altitude the aeronaut remained for about four
minutes. A month later de Rozier and a passenger&mdash;the
Marquis d&#8217;Arlandes&mdash;were bold enough to risk a
flight in a Montgolfier balloon. This time the ascent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
was made from Paris, and the balloonists flew for five
minutes before descending, reaching a height of 500 feet.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Coal-gas superseded hot air in the filling of
balloons, the latter being unsatisfactory, seeing that it cooled
rapidly and allowed the balloon to descend; the only
alternative being to do what some of the first aeronauts
did, and burn a fire below the neck of their balloon
even when in the air. But the dangers of this were
great, seeing that the whole envelope might easily
become ignited. With balloons filled with coal-gas&mdash;modern
examples of which are seen in Figs. <a href="#Fig_72">72</a> and <a href="#Fig_72a">72A</a>&mdash;long
flights were possible, but they had always this
disadvantage&mdash;the voyagers were at the mercy of the
wind, and could not fly in any direction they might
choose. If the wind blew from the north then they
were driven south, the balloon being a bubble in the
air, wafted by every gust. Aeronauts became disgusted
with this inability to guide the flight of a balloon, and
many quaint controls were tested; such, for example,
as the use of a large pair of oars with which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
balloonist, sitting in the car of his craft, rowed vigorously
in the air. But this method found little favour;
and it was followed in due course by the use of small
steam engines and electric motors, which were made to
turn propellers such as are used in aeroplanes. For
such experimental craft, the rounded form of gas-container
was abandoned and a cigar-shaped envelope
adopted, pointed at both ends, which could be more
easily driven through the air. An airship of a crude
and early type is seen in <a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73</a>.
It was built by an experimenter named Gifford, and in 1852
it flew at the rate of seven miles an hour.</p>

<p class="space-below1">When petrol engines became available,
they gave an impetus to the building of airships; for, like the aeroplane,
the airship needed a motive agent which gives a high
power for a low weight. One of the first to use a petrol
motor in an airship with success was M. Santos-Dumont,
whose name has been mentioned in connection with
aeroplanes. He tested small, light airships, driven by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
petrol engines and two-bladed propellers&mdash;as illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>; and with one of these, on a calm, still day,
he flew over Paris and round the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<p>Then by degrees came larger craft, more powerfully
engined, and built to attain greater speed. Hydrogen,
far more buoyant than coal-gas, was used to inflate their
envelopes, and so they obtained a greater &#8220;lift.&#8221; Speed
with the airship was recognised as vital. If it could not
fly fast it was at the mercy of the wind, gusts striking
powerfully against its envelope, and driving it off its course.</p>

</div>

<p>A typical craft, representing the first of those
navigated with any certainty, is shown in <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>.
A gas-containing envelope, made of a light, strong, varnished
fabric, is kept taut by the pressure of the gas within;
the car, constructed of wood or metal tubing, is suspended
by ropes from the envelope, and contains engine
and crew, with a two-bladed propeller revolving astern.
Such a machine, in its control, had an elevating-plane
and rudder, upon the same principle as those of the aeroplane.
One of the difficulties to be overcome was the
expansion and contraction of gas in the envelope owing
to differences in altitude and temperature. When the
craft ascended, its envelope completely inflated, the gas
began to dilate owing to the outer air becoming less
dense; and some had to be allowed to escape through
automatic valves. Then, should the machine descend
to a lower level, there was not sufficient gas in the
envelope to keep it tightly stretched, and it tended to
sag at the bow as it was driven through the air. To
prevent this kinking, which would have reduced the
speed of the airship, and made it difficult to control, an
interior chamber, called the &#8220;ballonette,&#8221; was fitted
to the envelope, as shown in <a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>. When
the gas-container was tightly filled, this ballonette lay empty
upon its lower surface; but, should the envelope tend to become
flaccid, through a loss of gas, a fan pumped air into the
ballonette; and, swelling out within the balloon, it
compensated for the gas which had escaped, and prevented
the envelope from losing its shape.

<p class="space-below1">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
The craft shown in <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a> is of the non-rigid
type; its car, that is to say, is hung by ropes from the envelope;
and when the envelope is deflated it can be detached
from the car and the machine packed away in a relatively
small space. But as airships were built larger, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
greater speeds were obtained, it became necessary to
strengthen the envelopes with some form of keel; and
this led to a type which is known as the semi-rigid, and
is developed successfully in France. <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a>
illustrates an airship of this build. Along the lower side of its
envelope is placed a light, rigid framework or keel, and
from this is suspended the car which contains engines and crew.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
small, non-rigid ships and the very large machine which
is built with an entirely rigid framework, and has its
example in the Zeppelin. The maker forms a skeleton
hull of aluminium or some light metal alloy, a method
that is shown in <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>. The hull of a
Zeppelin, slightly more than 500 feet in length, is sheathed with
tightly stretched fabric; and within it are the gas-containers&mdash;a
row of seventeen separate balloons, each in a
compartment by itself, and containing a total of nearly
1,000,000 cubic feet of gas&mdash;which give these airships a
lifting power of close upon 30 tons. The arrangement
of the gas-holders, and the general outline of the machine,
may be observed from <a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a>. The vessel
offers comparatively little resistance to the air, despite its size,
and this is due to the finely tapering shape of the hull;
while its rigidity allows it to be driven at speeds of more
than 50 miles an hour. The lifting capacity, also,
enables long flights to be made. Taking up crew and
petrol, such a craft can remain aloft for several days,
and travel distances of more than 1000 miles.</p>

At first, flying slowly and with unreliable motors,
these very large airships were at the mercy of the wind,
particularly when man&#339;uvring near the ground. Trained
crews were necessary to handle them, and they had to
be housed in huge and expensive sheds, as will be
realised from a glance at <a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>. But for
the one ardent pioneer, Count Zeppelin, it is doubtful whether
large, rigid craft would have been built at all. After
costing many thousands, they ran the risk of being
dashed to earth in a squall and hopelessly wrecked.
Such a fate, indeed, befell one ship after another that
Count Zeppelin launched. But he refused to be discouraged,
and went on doggedly until his private fortune
was gone. Then, magnificent flights having been made,
the Government came to his aid; while the German
people, immensely proud of his achievements, subscribed
more than £300,000 for the furtherance of his tests.
And so now the Zeppelin&mdash;powerfully engined, better
built, and handled by expert crews&mdash;is the Dreadnought
of the German air-fleet, flying hundreds of miles over
the North Sea, co-operating with warships as a scout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
and flashing messages by wireless for distances of 300 miles.</p>

<p>The airship, for long-distance reconnoitring,
stands at present unrivalled. It can remain in the air for days,
sweeping over sea or land, and reporting constantly to
its headquarters. For night flying, also, it is at present
the superior of the aeroplane, being navigable in darkness,
and having an ability to hover above a given spot,
its engines silent, and its presence undetected by those below.

torpedo-boat is perfected; immediately it is launched, and ready

  <p class="blockquot space-below1">
This photograph, taken by a passenger in a Grahame-White biplane,
gives an excellent idea of the view that may be obtained from a
machine in flight. Another aeroplane is flying past the enclosures,
and there is a Midland railway train in the distance.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
As soon as they became reliable, and could be used
in war, aeroplanes and airships were pressed into service
as scouts&mdash;their task being to ascend, spy out the land
below, and return with news to their starting-points.
That was the first conception of their use, and War
Departments looked no farther. But when machines
were built in numbers, and air fleets began to form,
strategists saw the complications that would ensue. If
A has a fleet of aircraft and B also, and A and B are
at war, then the aim of each will be to hamper the
other&#8217;s air-scouts, and destroy them whenever possible.
Here, again, is the theory of move and counter-move.
The air-scout, flying above an army, may see its secret at
a glance; therefore steps must be taken to keep him off, to
drive him away, to blow him to pieces and all of his kind.</p>

<p>This may be done with a cannon from the
ground, but the method is not certain. Special guns have been
built which will point into the air, can be sighted quickly,
and will fire a shell to a great height. If an aircraft
comes within range of them, and the gunner has time to
aim correctly, a bursting shell may bring the machine to
ground. But there are the &#8220;ifs&#8221; to be remembered.
The scout&mdash;favoured by a clear day and using his own
judgment&mdash;may be able to do his spying without venturing
within range of a land gun; and, even should he come
into firing distance, he may be shot at and missed. Such
guns are valuable, of course&mdash;mounted upon motor-cars
for speedy transport from place to place, and used also to
guard fortifications, and against aerial foes by a ship at sea.</p>

<p>Other guns are possible, besides those which
fire shells. Attention has been directed to the feasibility of
using a form of vortex-gun. This is a weapon rather
like a huge air-gun. It compresses a charge of air and
discharges it at a high velocity in a whirling vortex or
ring. This, invisible but immensely destructive, strikes
its target like a cyclone, and has been known&mdash;even with
the use of an experimental gun&mdash;to tear up fences at a
distance of several hundred yards. If such a gun was
discharged at an aircraft, and the aim was accurate, it is
argued that the machine would be hurled over and
wrecked by the force of the artificial hurricane.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>But something more than a land gun is necessary
to fight this new foe&mdash;something more certain; it must, in
a word, be sought and attacked in its own element, the
air. There are two ways at present in which aircraft
can engage each other; one machine may rise above its
adversary, and drop bombs upon it, or two craft may
seek to cripple each other by a fire from machine-guns.
Other and more deadly methods are discussed, and may
even be employed. Attacking an airship, for instance,
a man might ascend in a fast monoplane and charge
directly at his bulky foe; then, just before the impact,
he might spring from his machine and descend by means
of a parachute, leaving his empty craft to crash into the
airship and cut a gash through its hull. Many things
may be done, in fact, when aerial war is faced; but as
tactics are now discussed, and plans made, machine-guns
and bombs are the weapons reckoned feasible.</p>

<p>When one imagines two craft man&#339;uvring
for position, and about to engage in a duel in the air, speed
would seem a vital need; and here, when opposed to
the airship, an aeroplane has advantage. But airships
are being built larger and faster in flight; and the speed
of an aeroplane, when it has to carry the burden of a
gun, is lessened perceptibly; added to which is the fact
that, owing to its weight-lifting capacity, the airship can
raise a heavier type of gun. The airship may be likened
to the battleship of the sky, and the fighting aeroplane
to a cruiser; and it seems likely that, in actual warfare,
several of the latter will be detailed to attack an airship.</p>

<p>Already, anticipating war in the air, a fighting
aeroplane has been evolved; and a machine of this type is
shown in <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a>. The body, in which pilot and gunner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
sit, is armoured lightly with plates which will resist the
penetration of a bullet. Such armouring was found
necessary after the use of aeroplanes in Tripoli and the
Balkans. When flying unavoidably low in these campaigns,
and when fired at from the ground, the wooden
bodies of machines were pierced by shot, and in several
instances their occupants wounded.</p>

<p>The fighting aeroplane sketched is an
experimental machine&mdash;as are all those built at present for aerial
war. It carries no very powerful gun, and is not the formidable
craft the future will evolve; but it would have, none the
less, a definite value in time of war. When used with
an army in the field it would drive off an enemy&#8217;s scouts,
attack armed and hostile craft, and harass and cripple an
airship should it chance to meet one. It need not rely
solely upon its gun. Bombs may be carried and dropped
when opportunity offers; and as an improvement upon
the early method, which was simply to throw these from
the machine, there are releasing mechanisms now devised
which carry a number of projectiles and drop them one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
by one as a lever is moved (see <a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a>). The bombs,
which are long, pointed, and balanced so that they
will fall head first, are clipped round a barrel rather
like that of a revolver, which is fixed beneath
the aeroplane&#8217;s hull just below the occupants&#8217; seat.
Mechanism causes the carrying chamber to revolve and
bring each bomb against a releasing catch, which&mdash;at a
movement of the marksman&#8217;s lever&mdash;throws it outwards and downward.</p>

<p>Bomb-sighting instruments are now being tested, so
that a pilot may drop a missile with accuracy upon a given spot.
In the early experiments, when a pilot merely leaned forward
as he flew, bomb in hand, and guessed his aim, the majority went
wide of their mark. Several factors enter
into this problem of aim. There is the speed of the
machine, its height above the ground, and the question
whether a wind may affect the fall of the bomb.
Dropped haphazard, a bomb is unlikely to reach its
mark. In sighting instruments now provided the
marksman finds his altitude, estimates his speed by
the time his craft takes to pass between two points on
the land below, and then makes an allowance for side-drifting
owing to the influence of the wind.</p>

<p>Bombs of many types are being made. Some
weigh about 10 lbs., and are filled with several pounds of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
extremely high explosive. Others are what is known as
incendiary bombs; when they strike an object they burst
into flames, and are intended to cause fires on the roofs
of buildings or supply stores. A single aeroplane,
dropping bombs in war, would not be likely to have
much effect; but the plan will be to equip squadrons of
these machines, their crews trained to sweep in unison
over the point attacked, and rain down bombs in a
ceaseless and destructive stream.</p>

<p>There is a risk for airmen when they carry a
load of explosives. Should they make a bad landing, or fall to
the ground and wreck their craft, there is the probability
that their bombs would explode from the impact and
blow them to pieces. This danger has been realized,
and a form of safety bomb is now being used in tests.
Each bomb is fitted with a safety catch, and unless this
is released the bomb cannot explode, no matter how
hard it strikes the ground. The manner in which the
catch disengages itself is ingenious. Upon the rear of
the bomb is a tiny propeller, which spins in the air
as the bomb drops from the machine; and as it turns
it uncoils a spring, which releases the safety catch and
makes the bomb operative&mdash;but not until after it has
fallen about 100 feet.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Airships, like aeroplanes, are being
armed with guns and bombs; and their power of raising weights
enables them to carry heavy weapons. Large and
highly destructive bombs have been tested in the
German airships, being released over the sea and aimed
at targets in the form of rafts. Latest-type airships
also carry guns in their cars; and the Zeppelins have
a platform upon the tops of their hulls, reached by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
a ladder through the middle of the ship, from which
a machine-gun can be fired upward. This is a very
necessary precaution, and is intended to frustrate the
attack of an aeroplane. It would be the aim of the
latter, whenever possible, to man&#339;uvre above its big
enemy&mdash;as suggested in <a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a>&mdash;and drop
a bomb upon its hull. Hence the construction of the top
platform of the airship, from which her gunners can
direct a vigorous fire aloft.</p>

</div>

<p>The ability of an airship to navigate at
night, and steal unobserved above the land, gives it grim
possibilities as a weapon of destruction. It motors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
quiet, and no lights showing, it can drift with the
wind over a harbour or fortification, and drop bombs
which will fall upon those below out of an empty sky.
Searchlights would be used, of course, from the positions
attacked, and artillery fired upward, but the airship
would be a silent, elusive shape&mdash;difficult to see and
more difficult to hit.</p>

<p>Here, though, would be work for land or sea
planes. It would be the aim of our Admiralty, upon the outbreak
of war, to patrol the coast with a service of
armed aircraft. A number of air-stations, at which
machines are housed, are already in existence&mdash;mainly
along the north-east coast. Between station and station
the craft would fly in war, providing a continuous
patrol, the aim being to shut out hostile craft, and
attack a squadron of the enemy, should it approach land.</p>

<p>The observer in a sea-plane, under favourable
conditions, can also detect the movements of a sub-marine,
his height above the water enabling him to
see beneath its surface and discern the shape of the
vessel, even when it is submerged. This would be of
value in war, as proved in man&#339;uvres with our fleets.
A sea-plane, patrolling the entrance to a harbour, can
send a warning by wireless should hostile submarines&mdash;invisible
to all save the aerial watcher&mdash;seek to
steal in upon a destructive raid.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The air-patrol would play its part, too,
if an enemy attempted to land troops. Flying above transports
as they neared the coast, the planes would drop
bombs upon them. Many of the patrols, also, would
be equipped with wireless, and would scout in search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of an enemy&#8217;s fleet, reporting constantly to the land
stations as they flew.</p>

<p>A coastal sea-plane, as now planned, is
a craft having, say, two engines, each devolving 120 h.p.,
with a wing span of some 80 feet, and an accommodation
in its hull for three men&mdash;the pilot, a combatant
with a machine-gun, and an observer with an installation
of wireless. But types are changing constantly,
and the tendency is to build larger craft. A machine
weighing a couple of tons is shown in <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a>,
and a novelty in regard to it is that it has wheels upon
either side of its boat-shaped car, upon which it can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
move on land, and which fold upward when it rests upon the water.</p>

<p>Long flights over-sea, in search, say, of
the assembling point of an enemy&#8217;s fleet, would be undertaken
by the naval airships. They will be relied upon, for example,
to scour the North Sea by day and night; and, poised high above
the water, they would be able to locate an enemy&#8217;s fleet when at an immense distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a type of aeroplane which will be
carried to sea when a fleet sails, stowed in sections within
the hull of a transport ship. This machine&mdash;a light,
high-speed craft&mdash;will be assembled upon the deck of
its parent ship, and launched into the air by special
mechanism, as there is not room for a machine to
run upon wheels, and leave the ship&#8217;s deck as it
might do upon land; the vessel, besides, might be
rolling in a high sea. In some cases a platform is
built upon the deck, either at the bow or stern, and
along this the aircraft moves, so as to gain speed for
its planes to lift. In one device, seen in <a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>,
the machine is mounted upon a light wheeled cradle, and
this is placed upon the starting-rail. Then, driven by its
propeller, the plane runs forward upon the cradle till it
reaches the end of the rail, when it glides into the
air, the cradle falling from it and dropping into the
sea, from which it is retrieved and drawn back on
board the ship. By another method, shown in <a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>,
the sea-plane is launched from a cable suspended
between two masts, and can come to rest upon the
cable again after a flight has been made. The machine
is hung upon the cable prior to making an ascent;
then the pilot starts his engine, and as his machine
glides forward along the cable he releases a catch
and soars into the air. Upon returning he flies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
beneath the cable, and makes his craft rise until the
&#8220;V&#8221;-shaped apparatus above his head is caught by
the cable and the catch becomes operative; then he
stops his motor, and his craft hangs from the cable
as it did before.</p>

<p>A flying scout, operating with a fleet at
sea and rising from the deck of a ship, would be of very
distinct value. When approaching an enemy he would
be sent aloft to reconnoitre, and would locate hostile
craft before men could see them from the ships below.
The utility of such a scout is proved by the lessons of
history. On one occasion, for instance&mdash;it was in 1805&mdash;Nelson
was waiting to intercept a French fleet at
Toulon. But they managed to steal out unobserved,
and Nelson chased them to the West Indies before
he caught them. If he had had an aeroplane to send
up and keep watch, he would not have missed his enemy.</p>

<p>The air-scouts of a fleet would note also
the approach of airships, and could spy upon harbours
or fortifications when an attack was being made upon
them from the sea.</p>

<p>At present, it must be remembered, the possibilities
of an air-fleet are vague&mdash;all at least save one; and
that is the utility of an airship or plane for scouting.
The value of aircraft in this direction has been proved,
not only in peace man&#339;uvres but in war; but as to
what destructive work an aeroplane can accomplish,
or how machines will fight when they meet in mid-air,
there is only theory for a guide. That an aircraft
may carry explosives, and drop them with accuracy,
is now an established fact; also that a machine-gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
can be mounted upon a machine, and fired successfully
at a target while the craft is in flight. But no country,
as yet, has equipped itself with a squadron of fighting
aeroplanes. For one thing, owing to the fact that
powerful aviation motors are only just becoming
available, craft are still small in size; and this limits
them to the carrying of a light gun. What is wanted,
and what will be built in time, is a large, armoured,
high-speed craft, having more than one engine, carrying
a crew, and being able to bear the load of a
powerful gun. In war, had a Commander a squadron
of such machines, he would use them for attacking
an enemy&#8217;s supply stores and ammunition parks, for
blowing up railway lines, and for harassing troops
when they were on the march; and he would launch
them, of course, when necessary against hostile aircraft
which might approach his own lines.</p>

<p>In the first instance, in the case of a great
war, there will be a battle in the air; and how severe this
will be must depend upon the strengths of the air-fleets
opposed to each other. Command of the air,
like command of the sea, will be all-important. If
one Commander-in-Chief can cripple and disorganise
his opponent&#8217;s air-fleet, it will be like blinding his
enemy. He himself, still well served by his air-scouts,
will note all the movements of his enemy;
but this enemy, with an air fleet driven back, and
most of its machines disabled, will be enveloped
in what has been called &#8220;the fog of war&#8221;; he
will glean no more as to his enemy&#8217;s tactics, that is to
say, than can be obtained by cavalry or foot scouts.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Not only the fighting aeroplanes, but the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
equipment of the air-fleet, will play a part in the aerial
battles of the future. Surprisingly intricate, and little
known, is the organisation of a squadron of war machines.
There must be trained mechanics in large numbers, and
they must be driven from place to place in motors,
according to the movements of the machines they serve.
Then the aeroplanes, if necessary, must be packed on
lorries and taken across country by road; and there
must be portable sheds upon the landing grounds, in
which they may be housed at night. There needs to be
an equipment of spare machines also; and a number of
travelling workshops with skilled engineers, which can
be rushed from place to place for the repair of damaged
craft. A sketch of one of these workshops on wheels,
which are vital to the organisation, is seen in <a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a>.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-below2">It seems likely that the air-fleet of
the future will be composed of craft of many types. There will be
the long-distance scout&mdash;a machine capable of flying for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
many hours at moderate speed and surveying wide
tracts of country. Then there will be a flotilla of very
fast, single-seated machines, used for a dash above an
enemy&#8217;s force. These high-speed scouts will run the
gauntlet of the enemy&#8217;s destroyers, rushing into the
danger zone and sweeping out again, rather like a
torpedo-boat in naval war. Then there will be the
fighting squadron&mdash;machines armoured and carrying
powerful guns, which will fight the enemy&#8217;s war-planes
and give battle to hostile airships; and there may be a
further type of destructive plane for use against the
forces on land. This would be a machine well armoured,
with its motors silenced, and perhaps with transparent
wings. It would steal upon ammunition parks and
supply trains, firing with its guns and raining down
bombs; and such a craft would be used, also, to seek
and attack the aircraft stations of the enemy. These
would be protected, of course, by high-angle guns and
patrol planes. Immense damage might be wrought by
bombs were hostile craft to discover, and attack without
resistance, a squadron of machines in their sheds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
A machine which does not exist now, but which may
be built before long, is an aeroplane transport for troops.
This would be a very large craft, built entirely for
weight-lifting. It would raise a load of say ten or more
men; and such machines would be held in readiness so
that a relief column could be embarked in them and
carried at high speed to some point, perhaps a number
of miles distant, at which reinforcements were needed
urgently. Could such aeroplane transport be organised,
and handled with success, it might be of the highest
value during a battle. If a thousand machines were
built, each carrying ten men, and they made three flights
to some given spot, a force of 30,000 men could be
transported by air; and even with a slow-flying, weight-carrying
machine, a distance of say 30 miles should be
transversed in half-an-hour. Battles have been won by
virtue of forced marches, thus bringing troops to some
vantage-point before an enemy expects them. Napoleon,
for example, was a master of such quickly-delivered
blows. Day and night, on many occasions, he hurried
his tired troops across country; and what would he have
given to embark a column upon aeroplanes, and send
them high over hills and forests at the speed of an express train?</p>

<p>Experts do not care to prophesy what will
happen, say in the next great war, if flying machines fight
in large numbers. That there will be such fighting is
agreed; but what form it will take, and what damage
the combatants will do each other, are problems time
alone can solve. When the tactics of fighting aircraft
are studied there is one point always to be remembered;
and this is, that machines can steer not only to and fro
and from side to side, but can also move up and down;
and this introduces a confusion which does not exist in
any other form of war. On the land, and upon the sea,
two machines fighting must move always on the same
plane; but in the air one may rise above the other, or
dive swiftly below it, in addition to the man&#339;uvres
possible by wheeling and circling, and sweeping in
suddenly to an attack.</p>

<p>Mr. H. G. Wells, in his novel <i>The War in the Air</i>,
considers that aerial battles will develop into a series of
duels, fought between isolated machines. By this he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
means that, although a squadron of fighting craft may
move into action in regular formation, the speed at
which they are able to fly, and the fact that they can
rise or descend, will soon scatter them in all directions;
with the consequence that a couple of machines, singling
each other out for combat, will wheel and circle away
from the other craft and fight their duel alone. Such
a scattered, indecisive form of fighting would undoubtedly
take place to-day were aircraft called to meet in war,
and for the reason that the machines forming a squadron
would have no satisfactory means of communicating
with each other. In a fleet of warships, when it fights,
the discipline is perfect, and the signals from the flagship
instantly obeyed. A number of units can in this way
be made to fight as one. But in the air, until wireless
telegraphy is applied with greater certainty, it will be
difficult for a commander to guide the movements of his
craft. Flag-signalling would be slow; the flags might
not be seen. What would be needed is some almost
instantaneous method of altering a battle position, or of
turning and sweeping suddenly upon an enemy. An
ideal communication, in the delivery of some swift blow,
would be by wireless telephone. Then a Commander,
taking up his instrument as he flew high above the
contending craft, could speak an order in an easily-read
code, which would make the vessels of his fleet turn
swiftly and correctly upon any new course.</p>

<p>First of all, in aerial warfare, there will
come a chase between the light, fast-flying scouts and the armoured
planes which will be on watch for them. As two armies
approach each other, upon the eve of battle, there will
be one definite question which a Commander-in-Chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
will ask of the officer who is in command of his
aeroplanes. He will say: &#8220;Find out for me how the
enemy is massing his men.&#8221; This information will be
needed as quickly as it can be obtained; unless he
knows, approximately, the formation of his opponent&#8217;s
troops, he will be unable to plan the disposition of his
own forces. To obtain this news, without a moment&#8217;s
waste of time, the officer in charge of the aeroplanes will
send out high-speed scouts&mdash;expert officers, mounted
upon single-seated craft; just as, in the days before
flying, the Duke of Wellington would choose special
men, mount them upon picked horses, and send them
out to obtain news at all costs.</p>

<p>These high-speed scouts, flying at more than
100 miles an hour, will sweep in towards the enemy, seeking
the shelter of clouds or of banks of mist, and making
long detours when necessary so as to try and avoid the
patrols. It will be the same story in the air as was told
formerly on land; there will be the spy trying to creep
through, and the chain of flying outposts making it their
business to stop him. Speedy in flight, and yet carrying
a formidable gun, these patrols will rush upon the
unarmed scout and strive to put him out of action. His
only protection will be his speed. He will wheel, dodge,
and eventually turn tail. All the time his aim will be to
see what lies below him, to watch the marchings of the
troops which will look so tiny and remote, and form an
opinion in his mind as to what the battle line will be.
These single scouts will need to be picked men. A
great responsibility will be theirs, and a great risk also.
They will, in fact, take their lives in their hands, and
nothing will save them from being sent crashing to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
death but their own wit and skill in the handling of their machines.</p>

<p>This perilous work done, there may come a clash
between the lighter fighting craft&mdash;the machines which
form the screens of outposts, as they move gradually
nearer to each other. One or other may be forced to
yield and fly, scattering in confusion; and after this
there may be the aerial battle proper, in which the large,
heavily-armed craft, and the giant airships with their
batteries of guns, will come into action. The aeroplane,
in fighting an airship, will have the advantage that it
offers a smaller mark, and one also which is moving
rapidly through the air. It may also be struck many
times before it is crippled or put out of action. Shot
passing through its planes will make little difference to
it; and the occupants will sit in a hull which is armoured.
But an accurately-placed shell, bursting in the heart of
the machine&mdash;that is to say, among its machinery and
crew&mdash;will no doubt prove disastrous; and the airship,
with its long fragile hull, must prove vulnerable also.
Well-aimed shots will pierce it; a bomb from above
may set it on fire. In the case of the Zeppelin,
though carrying its gas in a series of compartments, a
number of hits may be sustained before the vessel is out
of action. But, when all is said and done, both aeroplanes
and airships are frail machines&mdash;the one with
slender, lightly built planes, and the other with a hull
which is protected by nothing stouter than a rubbered
fabric. So if guns are well handled, craft must suffer.
To reflect upon such fighting reminds one of a remark
of Mr. Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty. Commenting
upon the growing power of a warship&#8217;s guns,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and showing how the armour with which craft are
protected has not grown in efficiency to keep pace with
the striking force of a modern projectile, he said that the
fighting between two heavily armed leviathans would
be like &#8220;two egg-shells battering at each other with
hammers.&#8221; So with armed aircraft; well-placed shells
will rip and tear; and the destruction of a hard-fought
engagement must undoubtedly be heavy.</p>

<p>Straight shooting, as in naval war, will be the vital
need&mdash;that and a cool, quick skill in the man&#339;uvring of
a machine. The airship gunners, having a steady firing
platform, will be at an advantage over aeroplane crews;
but the latter in their turn will have quick man&#339;uvring
power and high speed. In the engagement between
an airship and several planes, such as is certain to take
place, the latter will be in the position of torpedo-boats
when they attack a battleship. They will dash in, relying
upon speed and the suddenness of their onslaught;
and the saving of the craft attacked will rest upon the
skill of her gunners. By a vicious, accurate fire they
will seek to check the rush; and one or more of their
assailants will crumple and fall headlong. The survivors,
delivering their fire point-blank into the hull and cars of
their opponent, will dive and swerve out of range; and
while they are engaging the airship upon either side,
one or more of their consorts will climb to a higher
altitude, and endeavour to drop bombs upon the airship
from above. To prevent them swooping near, as they
circle above, marksman will be busy with machine-guns
upon the top platform of the airship.</p>

<p>Before and after the meeting of the main air-fleets,
there will be duels and scattered fighting. Swift raids
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
will be made by bomb-dropping craft, which will sweep
above the supply stores of their enemy, attack his troops
on the march, or seek to blow up the railway lines along
which he is bringing his reinforcements. To drive off
these raiders there will be the vigilant patrols; all
vulnerable points being guarded by air as well as by land.</p>

<p>This aerial fighting, which will wax and wane,
dying down only to be renewed with a greater fierceness, must
precede the battles of land or sea; and so, while the
aerial armies are struggling for supremacy, those moving
upon the land, or the fleets steaming upon the water,
will be man&#339;uvring for position and creeping stealthily
nearer. A conquest in the air, if it be decisive, may
spell also a victory upon land and sea. A nation which
has its air-fleet destroyed or crippled will lie helpless
before the attacks of hostile craft, and will lose also the
aid of its aerial scouts and spies. It will fight, therefore,
in the dark, assailed by a foe against which it cannot
defend itself.</p>

<p>All-important will be these aerial battles;
granted a country wins supremacy in the air, its blows by land
or sea can be delivered with a crushing force, unhampered
either by attacks or spying from above. This fact is
realised by every War Department of Europe. Aerial
warfare is being studied closely; and the first armed
craft, though they carry small guns, will pave the way
for a powerful, armoured, multi-engined cruiser of the clouds.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <small>AT A MODERN AERODROME</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">The workshops&mdash;Some problems of
construction&mdash;The building of a wing&mdash;Aeroplane races&mdash;The
Aerial Derby&mdash;Passenger flights.</p>

<p>The first flying grounds were merely open
tracts of land, chosen more or less haphazard, and offering
no more than a smooth landing-point and an absence of
treacherous gusts. But as flying developed, men came
together with their machines, and groups of sheds were
built. Then pupils arrived to learn to fly, and gradually
an organisation was evolved. From a single rough
shelter, perched perhaps at the brink of some stretch of
waste land, pilots found themselves promoted to a row
of neatly-built sheds, with a workshop attached to them
in which aeroplanes might be built or repaired. And
from this stage, not being contented with what could
be found in the way of natural flying grounds, men
uprooted trees, filled up ditches and hollows, erected
fences, barriers, and gates, and created what we know as
the modern aerodrome&mdash;a centre, that is to say, where
machines are designed, constructed, and flown, where
there are regular schools for pupils and apprentices, and
to and from which the airmen pass when making cross-country
flights. Public interest has also aided the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
growth of aerodromes; people are eager to see aeroplanes
fly, and will come in thousands to an air meeting.
So, as at the London Aerodrome, Hendon, there are
public enclosures and pavilions, in addition to the
buildings concerned solely with flight; and flying
races and other contests are arranged, in which the
pilots at the aerodrome, as well as those who come
from other grounds, meet each other in friendly rivalry.</p>

<p>To-day, the aerodrome is the rendezvous of
those who fly, or build machines, or seek to learn the art;
while the general public, thronging the stands on racing
days, learns more of aviation in an hour than it would
in a month by merely reading of flights that have been
made. All day, from the moment it grows light until
the final dusk, there is activity upon the aerodrome.
Machines are brought out and tested; pilots arrive from
other flying grounds; there is a hum of activity in the
workshops; and in regular batches, with this instructor
and that, are pupils taught to handle a craft in flight. It
is, to those who have only a vague knowledge of aviation,
a surprise indeed to spend a day at an aerodrome. They
imagine that the industry is no more than haphazard; that
a few machines are built&mdash;mostly in small workshops, and
that there is neither method nor organisation in their
making. And then, perhaps, they are taken through a
modern factory, and hold such views no more.</p>

<p>By the work of trained men, who have become
highly skilled in their art, are the parts of a flying
machine built and assembled; and no sooner is one
machine wheeled from the shops and takes the air, than
another is being made ready. Governments give orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
for large batches of craft; aeroplanes of new types are
built and tested. And, in all departments of the factory,
the output of work is constant and well ordered.</p>

<p>First, of course, the machine is designed; and
those in the drawing office are specially trained men. The
planning of an aeroplane is a matter of no simplicity.
First of all there is to be considered what may be termed
the main feature of the machine; whether, that is to
say, it is to be built for speed, for weight-lifting, or for
aerial touring. For high-speed flying it will need small
sustaining wings; for weight-lifting, its area must be
large; while in aerial touring there is need for a medium-paced,
highly reliable craft, which will ascend quickly or
plane slowly to earth. The characteristic of the machine
determined, there are other problems to be studied&mdash;such,
for example, as the placing of the engine and propeller,
the position of the body containing the pilot and
passenger, and the arrangement of the control surfaces.
And, above all, the craft must be built strongly. No
matter how well a machine may fly, or how skilled its
pilot, there is peril should its structure have a weakness,
or some hidden defect. For months, perhaps, in the
early days of aviation, a faulty machine would fly; and
then some day, subjected to an abnormal strain, a wing
or a tail would break, and the airman would fall to his
death. Should an aeroplane dive suddenly, there may
be a tremendous strain upon its planes; and in a violent
wind, while its motor is thrusting it through the gusts,
it is sustaining shocks and jars which may be of
tremendous force. It is not, indeed, the ordinary wear
of flying that a designer needs to guard against, but
those excessive strains&mdash;caused perhaps by reckless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
flying, or the onslaught of a gale&mdash;to which a machine
may be exposed.</p>

<p>Security lies in one direction only; and that
is to give a machine such a factor of safety as may be equal
to all demands&mdash;normal or abnormal. So a designer
calculates, before he draws out the plan of a wing, just
what pressure it may have to resist in ordinary flight;
and then to this he adds such strains as might be caused
by diving or by violent gusts. To be completely on the
safe side, to be guarded beyond question from any
excessive shock, a modern-type aeroplane will be given
a factor of safety that may be ten or twelve times more
than is necessary in the ordinary passage of the machine
through the air; and this security lies not only in its
planes, say, or its controlling gear, but in every wire and
bolt and stay which goes to its construction. And, by
this precaution alone, has one of the gravest risks of
aviation been removed. Formerly, when men built
machines, they did so by what is termed rule-of-thumb;
the builder, that is to say, relied upon his own judgment
and experience&mdash;small though these were&mdash;and submitted
his plans to no rigorous or scientific test. And so lives
were lost. But now, even when he &#8220;loops the loop,&#8221;
or fights a 60-mile-an-hour gale, a pilot has confidence
in the machine he flies. He knows it is strong as a
whole; that it has no hidden weakness or faulty spar;
that he may rely upon it implicitly, even under the
acutest strain.</p>

<p>The building of an aeroplane is a problem of great
difficulty&mdash;such a problem, in fact, as no other designers
of craft, either for land or sea, are called upon to face.
The machine must be immensely strong, and yet it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
essential that it should be light. Its planes cannot bear
through the air more than a certain number of pounds
per square foot; and so if it is to be a practical craft,
and raise a useful load, every pound that can be saved
in its construction has a definite value. It is because
such work is so intricate that there is special interest in
a visit to an aeroplane factory. Here, in large, well-lighted
workrooms, are skilled craftsmen employed.
Some of the men, now risen to be foremen of their departments,
made their first acquaintance with aviation in
the very early days. Then there were no factories, and
an inventor, regarded invariably as a &#8220;crank,&#8221;
found a mechanic who was intelligent to help him, and built
his craft humbly in some outhouse or shed. Now these
handy mechanics, who perhaps forsook a post in a motor
works to join some scheme to build an aeroplane, find
themselves in positions of trust in a large and flourishing
factory&mdash;turning out aircraft for Governments and for
private use, and with a staff of workers under their control.</p>

<p class="space-below1">An impression of one of the workrooms
in a modern factory may be gained from a study of the photograph on
<a href="#PLATE_XIII">Plate XIII</a>. This was obtained in the Grahame-White
factory at Hendon. In the foreground of the picture,
resting upon trestles, is one of the sustaining planes of a
machine. It is in its rough stage, prior to being covered
with fabric, and the method of construction may be seen.
The system is to use two or more main-spars, which
run the whole length of the wing; and above and below
these pass the thin wooden strips which form a series
of ribs. <a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>, representing a monoplane
wing in skeleton, should make clear this method of building.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Although such a wing may appear frail, it has in reality
a surprising strength. English ash and silver spruce, in
carefully selected lengths, are the woods used chiefly in
aeroplane construction, and calculations have shown
them able to bear a greater strain, weight for weight,
than would a framework made of mild steel. In the
future, of course, when aircraft are built far larger, wood
will cease to be employed&mdash;and partly for the reason
that, when wing constructions of great sizes are
needed, it will be impossible to obtain timber that can be
cut into spars of a sufficient length and soundness.
Then, probably, will come the day of high-tension
steel, and we shall have a liner of the air built almost
after the fashion of a leviathan of the sea; but for the
making of a small machine, at any time, there should be
an advantage in the use of wood.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-below1">Returning to an inspection of <a href="#PLATE_XIII">Plate XIII</a>,
one may observe, immediately behind the men who are
working upon the wing-frame, two completed floats for a
hydro-aeroplane; while behind these there is a workbench;
and in the far distance, the hull and the centre
wing-sections of a craft under construction. To the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
right of the centre work-table may be seen a man seated
at a sewing machine; he is busy with the lengths of
fabric which will cover the wooden framework of the
wings. Upon the extreme left of the photograph, partly
completed and in the form of a girder construction of
wood, is the body of an aeroplane. Put together
scientifically and from sections of wood specially tested,
a remarkable strength may be obtained by such a method
of building. <a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a> shows how a girder aircraft
body, supported by trestles only at its ends, may support from
its centre, without yielding, a tray containing a number of heavy weights.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91.</span>&mdash;Testing
the girder-built body of an aircraft.</p>
</div>

<p>When the wings of a machine are ready and
have been sheathed with their fabric, and when its hull
and chassis have been built, it finds its way into the
assembling shop. The motor is bolted in its framework,
the propeller fitted, and the whole construction receives
a final overhaul. And then one morning it is wheeled
out upon the aerodrome&mdash;its planes spotless and
gleaming in the sun&mdash;and is tested for the first time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
flight. In many cases, so great has been the progress
in aeroplane building, that a new machine will do
just what its designer intended it should; there is no
longer any doubt as to the craft&#8217;s ability to take the air.
But minor adjustments have usually to be made, none
the less, before a machine is delivered to its purchaser;
and in the case of a war machine, bought, say, for the
Admiralty or the Army, it needs to perform&mdash;prior to
being taken over&mdash;a series of special tests. It must
show that it can ascend rapidly and fly at a certain
speed, and it must raise a specified weight of fuel, in
addition to that of its pilot and passenger. The War
Office has prepared a list of its requirements for military
machines of different types; and aeroplane builders, if
they plan craft for Government acceptance, must be
prepared to submit them to the trials arranged. A light
scouting machine, when it is tested, must be able to lift
its pilot and fuel sufficient for a flight of 300 miles, and
it needs to vary its speed from 30 to 85 miles an
hour. Larger machines, built for scouting, have to
carry the weight of a pilot and observer and 80 lbs. of
wireless apparatus; while a craft to be used in fighting
must raise&mdash;in addition to its crew&mdash;the weight of a gun
and ammunition; this is estimated to represent 300 lbs.</p>

<p>What the maker usually does, when a craft
intended for the Government has been built and given a
preliminary testing, is to send it by way of the air either
to Farnborough, where the Royal Aircraft Factory is
situated, or to Eastchurch, in the Isle of Sheppey,
where the Royal Naval Air Service has its headquarters.
Then, with the pilot employed by the firm at
its levers, and some military or naval airman as his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
passenger, the machine is subjected to its trials; and if it
fails, say, to rise fast enough, or lifts an insufficient weight,
it is returned to its constructor to be adjusted and improved.
With sea-planes, naturally, there are tests upon
the water, both as to a craft&#8217;s ability to rise and descend.</p>

<p>Apart from the factory, or factories, upon a
modern aerodrome, there are the offices of the company which
controls it; and in addition the sheds of various firms
which, renting accommodation from the owners of the
ground, are operating flying schools or experimenting
with new machines. So that a day spent at an
aerodrome, and particularly at such grounds as Hendon
or Brooklands, is never for a moment dull. Even when
there is no air-racing, a fund of interest may be found in
the doings at the sheds; while on those days when a
programme of contests is carried out, and racing craft
are &#8220;banking&#8221; round the pylons, there is so much
to be seen that a spectator becomes almost bewildered.
Air-racing, as made popular by the proprietors of the
Hendon aerodrome, forms so fascinating a sight that, on
a day of public holiday, as many as 50,000 people will
assemble in the enclosures.</p>

<p>To stand near one of the pylons&mdash;wooden towers
which mark the turning-points of the course&mdash;and see
the air-racers come rushing by, is to gain such an
impression of speed as almost makes the watcher hold
his breath. The pilot in a flying race has one chief
aim: to fly the shortest way. Every fraction of a
second is of importance; and if he can circle the pylons
more skilfully than his rivals, he may win the race, even
though his machine&mdash;in its actual speed&mdash;may be no
faster than theirs. So a flying race, from the moment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the timekeeper waves his flag and the machines leap
from the starting line, is a contest of sheer nerve and
skill. To fly a winning course, upon a high-powered
craft, requires, indeed, a judgment that is exceptional.
Towards each of the mark-towers, hurtling through the
air at perhaps 100 miles an hour or more, comes the
airman with a roar and rush. Peering above his screen,
in the fierce wind-blast, he seeks to gauge distance and
speed; and here, if ever there was one, is a crucial test
of airmanship. The pilot knows that, if he would hope
to win the race, he must pass as close to each tower as
his skill can take him; and yet, even while he strains to
this end both nerve and eye, he must not forget for an
instant what is the penalty for error. Were he to press
too hard upon the rudder-bar, were the wing-tip to strike
the tower instead of sweeping past it, his machine would
swerve sideways with the momentum of its rush, and
break itself to fragments as it crashed upon the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p class="space-below1">Flying low, and with his motor emitting a
deep-throated roar, the airman comes tearing for a turn.
Some distance before reaching the pylon, he will begin
to &#8220;bank&#8221; his craft; he will, that is to say,
incline downward his inner wing-tip. Were he not to heel his
craft it would skid outwards through its pace, and swing
wide at the turn, thus losing a second or so of time.
Down, therefore, he dips this inner wing, until there may
seem no more than a foot or so between it and the
ground. The speed of the machine appears tremendous.
It has come up out of the distance, growing larger
moment by moment; and now it seems, as it rushes
towards the pylon, as though it must strike this structure
instead of wheeling past it. Those on the ground,
indeed, standing at the turn, find this illusion strong:
it seems to them certain that the airman will strike
the tower. But he, seated midway between the planes,
and with his eye ever watching his inner wing-tip, has a
better view-point and a clearer means of judgment, than the
watchers who are grouped beside the tower. Steeper he banks his
planes, until they seem nearly vertical; and then, with a swift,
powerful swing upon his rudder-bar, he sends his craft round.
The inner wing-tip appears almost to be sweeping the turf at
the foot of the tower. And those who may be standing against it,
watching this flashing wing-tip, feel an instinct to recoil; it seems
as though, with its fine-cut edge, it might sweep among them like
a scythe. But in reality there is no risk. The
airman, although he has swung for the turn at
lightning speed, has displayed an accuracy that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
perfect. A foot or two of clearance&mdash;no more&mdash;there
may be between his wing-tip and the tower;
but it is enough. In a flash he has circled and gone,
and has whirled away towards another turn&mdash;the roar
of his motor dwindling to a heavy drone. And so
he flies for lap after lap, controlling his machine so
superbly that it is difficult to realize that it is a man&#8217;s
hand, and not some mechanism, that guides the craft
upon its flight. A pylon on the flying track, with a
craft circling it, is seen in <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>,
and a photograph of a biplane, &#8220;banking&#8221; heavily
as it rounds a tower, on <a href="#PLATE_XIV">Plate XIV</a>.</p>

<p>Often, after a close-flown race, two perfectly-handled
monoplanes will rush round the last pylon and into the
finishing straight, and roar together past the judge&#8217;s box
in a flash of planes.</p>

<p class="space-below1">There is an international speed race,
for the Gordon-Bennett trophy, held every year, and to which reference
was made in regard to the first contest in 1909. Then,
it may be recalled, the speed of Curtiss the winner was
less than 50 miles an hour. But, mainly by a use of
more powerful engines, the pace of the competing craft
has been increased very largely from year to year, as

With such a growth in speed there has been, naturally,
a greater risk should some mishap occur; and
there are two pilots who, meeting with disaster while
flying in this great race, had cause to thank Providence
that they were not killed outright. One is the French
champion, Leblanc, who went to America with a 100-h.p.
Bleriot for the contest of 1910. When flying at high
speed, having nearly completed his course, Leblanc&#8217;s
motor stopped suddenly, owing to the failure of his
petrol. A strong wind was blowing across the track,
and, as he came planing down, the airman was swept
away sideways. Rushing steeply earthward, his craft
only partly in hand, he came into violent collision with
a telegraph pole. The bow of his machine struck the
pole, low down near its base; and so fierce was the
impact that the pole was snapped in two, despite the
fact that it was thick round as a man&#8217;s body. The front
of the monoplane was crumpled by the shock, and to
those who saw the accident, and heard the crash which
accompanied it, there seemed no chance that the pilot
should escape alive. And yet in reality, save for some
cuts and bruises, Leblanc was unhurt. At the moment
of the collision he had been hurled from his seat; shooting
out sideways over one wing, he had missed striking
the telegraph pole, and had avoided also any entanglement
with the wreckage of his machine. For some
distance he whirled through the air, so great was the
force of the collision; then, when he did touch ground,
it was upon a grassy bank, down which he rolled without
breaking a limb.</p>

<p>The late Gustave Hamel, whose tragic fate
has been so heavy a blow to aviation, lost control of a Bleriot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
when rounding a pylon in the 1911 race. The machine
side-slipped, and struck ground at 90 miles an hour. So
tremendous was the shock that the motor, torn from its
supports, went rolling far away across the ground, and
the body of the craft was reduced to a tangled wreckage.
Hamel, like Leblanc, was projected from his driving seat
by the impact. He slid out upon one wing, rolled across
this, and then went sprawling over the turf. Had he not
been thrown clear, had he remained within the hull and
been pinned amidst its fragments, it is almost certain
that he would have been killed; but as it was&mdash;striking
neither his head nor limbs against any obstruction&mdash;he
sustained a slight concussion and nothing more, and was
soon flying again.</p>

<p>An air-race which is more popular than any
other, and is seen each year by millions of spectators, is the
Aerial Derby. This was established in 1912, and it was
arranged that it should follow within a week after the
great horse-race which takes place on Epsom Downs.
For 81 miles, making a complete circuit of London, ran
the course of the first year&#8217;s race, the turning-points
being such towers or large buildings as might catch the
airman&#8217;s eye. There were seven competitors, six of
them with monoplanes, and the winner was T. O. M.
Sopwith, who flew the course in a 70-h.p. Bleriot in a
few minutes less than an hour and a half. Machines,
then, were not so reliable as they are now; nor were
pilots so expert; and there were quaint happenings in
this first race. Verrier, who flew a Maurice-Farman
biplane, took up with him a photographer, so that views
might be obtained from the air; but fog was encountered
and heavy cloud-banks, and the airman lost his way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
For hours he flew without any idea where he was going,
and once in the distance he caught sight of the sea.
Eventually, just as dusk had begun to fall, he groped
his way back to Hendon&mdash;which is the starting and
finishing point of each year&#8217;s race. Moorhouse, another
of the racers, lost his way also, wandering away over
Sevenoaks; while Valentine, uncertain as to his direction,
landed to make inquiries, and had an amusing
experience. A smooth field presented itself, and towards
this he planed, noticing that a solitary man was standing
in it. From him, after he had alighted, Valentine
sought to obtain guidance; but the man, dumbfounded
by the advent of the machine, which had swooped
suddenly towards him out of the empty air, seemed to
lose all power of speech. He stood in the field and
merely waved his arms, amazement written upon his
face; and, after trying in vain to make sense of his
gestures, Valentine had to fly farther on and alight again.</p>

<p>In 1913 the course was lengthened to a distance
of 94&frac12; miles, and this time Hamel, who flew at a speed of
76 miles an hour, and proved the winner, met with a
strange mishap while in the air. A brass petrol cap
was, by the vibration of the engine, shaken from the top
of a fuel tank in front of him; and the result was that
the spirit bubbled out and blew back into his face with
the rush of wind. He groped, half blinded, for the cap,
which had fallen upon the floor-boards of the machine.
But it was just beyond his reach, and he could not of
course relinquish his hold upon the controlling lever.
Prudence suggested a descent, but the time taken in
landing would, he reckoned, cost him his chance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
winning the race. To fly on, however, with the petrol
streaming into his eyes, was impossible; and yet he
could not, even by the most strenuous groping&mdash;and
with his machine swerving dangerously as he bent within
the hull&mdash;recapture this elusive cap. What was to be
done? Hamel, after a moment&#8217;s thought, solved the
problem neatly. He found that he could just reach the
tank with one hand; whereupon, leaning far forward in
his seat, he slipped a finger into the aperture from which
the petrol was escaping. The position was cramped
and awkward, and he could barely use his controls.
But descend he would not; and so he flew for nearly
30 miles, crouching half out of his seat, and with one
arm thrust rigidly forth. His determination was rewarded,
for he won the race.</p>

<p>But the pilot of a racing plane is no ordinary
man; none, indeed, but the most expert will dare to handle a
high-speed craft. With 160 h.p. within its frail, light
hull, and sustained in flight by the smallest of wings, the
machine must have a master hand upon its levers&mdash;a
hand light and yet sure, delicate and yet as strong as
steel. Those in France who fly these racing craft are
called the &#8220;record&#8221; men. Others, who do trick-flying
such as &#8220;looping the loop,&#8221; are known as the &#8220;artists.&#8221;</p>

<p>A daily feature of work upon the aerodrome
is the giving of passenger flights. People of all ages, and
in all walks of life, are now eager to fly. Some telephone
beforehand, and arrange an aerial journey with a pilot
whose skill they may admire; then they motor to the
aerodrome, find a plane standing ready, and are soon
aloft. Others, coming on days when there is racing,
walk to one of the booking-offices in the enclosures and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
pay their fee for an immediate flight. At Hendon, for
the convenience of those who want to fly, there is now a
scale of regular charges. A visitor may, by paying two
guineas, ascend and circle the flying ground twice. For
a flight outside the limits of the aerodrome, say in the
direction of Edgware, returning towards the Welsh
Harp, a fee of five guineas is charged; while an air
journey to Elstree and back, representing a distance of
16 miles, costs ten guineas. A flight enjoyed sometimes
by passengers who can afford the luxury, is from Hendon
to Brooklands and back; for this, a distance of about
38 miles, the fee is £26, 5s. Anyone who seeks to hire
an aeroplane and its pilot, as he might a motor-car, for a
long cross-country journey by air, will find the novelty
expensive: 20s. a mile is the fee charged, although this
is reduced to 15s. a mile if the return flight is made by
the passenger. On a popular day at the aerodrome,
when stands and enclosures are thronged, flights are
booked in great numbers, and several pilots may be
busy, taking one passenger after another.</p>

<p>Building and testing machines, holding air-races,
giving passenger flights; to these is the modern aerodrome
devoted. But there is another, and perhaps an
even more important, task, and this is to teach men how
to fly. Schools for tuition are numerous in these days,
and special machines are used and expert instructors
employed. The pupils who come to the flying schools&mdash;naval
and military officers and civilians from all walks
of life&mdash;increase largely in numbers from day to day.

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <small>THE FLYING SCHOOL</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">A pupil&#8217;s troubles in the early days&mdash;How
schools are organised to-day&mdash;Types of men who learn to fly&mdash;Amusing
things that happen&mdash;The stages of tuition.</p>

<p>In the early morning and in the evening are the
flying schools busy, for it is then as a rule that the wind blows
softly; and for his first flights, when he is new to the
control of a machine, the pupil needs conditions that are
favourable. Summer and winter, therefore, directly it
is light enough to see, the instructors bring out their
craft, and practice goes on until all the beginners have
had their turn, or perhaps until the wind rises and
prevents further flying until just before dusk. At the
large schools there are now two complete staffs of
teachers and mechanics: one takes the morning spell of
work, and is then free for the day, while the second
staff comes on duty in the evening. It is possible in
this way to avoid over-fatigue, and to ensure that both
instructors and helpers are fresh for their work.</p>

<p>It is amusing, nowadays, to look back, say,
to the year 1908, and recall some of the statements that were
made about learning to fly. It was, for instance, when
the Wrights began to train pupils, declared impossible
to teach an ordinary man to balance himself in the air.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
The Wrights could do it&mdash;yes; but they, contended the
critics, were altogether abnormal men. It was argued,
indeed, quite seriously, that the brothers had some
phenomenal gift&mdash;that they could move far more quickly
than ordinary men; that they were, in a word, two
aerial acrobats. But, when put to a practical test, such
arguments were proved idle. The first pupils who went
to the Wrights <i>did</i> learn to fly. They learned easily,
and without accident; and after this, growing in numbers
with rapidity, the world&#8217;s airmen were numbered in
fifties and hundreds, and then in thousands.</p>

<p class="space-below1">But there were some quaint happenings,
none the less, in these early days. The Wright machine, it will
be remembered, ran forward upon a length of rail before
it took the air; and the day came when, after a number
of flights with his instructor, a pupil was allowed to
glide by himself from the rail, and soar upward as gracefully
as he could. Some, being men of a cool temperament,
did in fact do just what was required: they tilted
their elevators very gently, and skimmed from the rail
with lightness and ease. But others, nervous and a
little over-anxious, drew back their levers too sharply.
The aircraft shot from the rail; then, robbing itself of
forward motion by the abruptness of the ascent, it came
to a standstill in the air and slid back tail-first towards
the ground&mdash;much to the discomfiture of the pilot, and
generally to the detriment of its rear-planes. The
penalty of a too sudden rise is illustrated by <a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>.</p>

<p>One astonishing fact, however, was soon proved
by such mishaps; it was that one could fall in an aeroplane,
and wreck perhaps both planes and landing gear, and
yet in no way damage one&#8217;s own person. When many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
men came to learn to fly, in fact, and some proved careless
or foolhardy, there were smashes so violent that the
novice in the machine was&mdash;at any rate by those who
saw what had happened&mdash;reckoned to be a dead man.
Yet when the rescuers reached the wreckage, expecting
the worst, they found the pilot crawling from beneath
it&mdash;looking a little dazed perhaps and worried, but quite
unhurt. What saves a man so often in an aeroplane
fall, is the fact that struts and spars break all around
him; and each, as it rips or splits, absorbs some fraction
of the shock. Before the blow reaches him, therefore,
it has lost its force; the breaking of the woodwork has
had a cushioning effect; and if he is well placed in his
machine, and is wearing a safety belt, he may survive
without injury such a smash as may reduce his craft to fragments.</p>

<p>In the first of the flying schools, before a
regular fee was charged to cover all a pupil&#8217;s expenses, the
breakages he incurred were charged upon a separate bill; and in
some instances, when a man proved clumsy, these items
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
reached a surprising total. There was one pupil,
humorously inclined, who went to a famous French
school in the very early days of aviation. He was
impetuous in handling his machine, and broke landing
gear and propellers with disconcerting frequency. And
for all these breakages bills were sent in to him&mdash;long,
formidable bills, very carefully totalled, and with each
mishap represented upon them by so many hundreds of
francs. Before long, indeed, regarding these bills with
a rueful smile, the novice had papered the walls of his
shed with them; and there they hung in long festoons,
almost in every direction that one looked. How much
it cost that unlucky pupil to learn to fly, none of his
friends could say; but he himself, perhaps humorously,
put it at a figure of several thousand pounds. He
declared, in fact, that what he paid for breakages amounted
to a sum sufficient to buy two or three aeroplanes, all brand new.</p>

<p class="space-below2">But at the present time, should he
damage his machine, the pupil need not concern himself. Before
beginning his tuition he pays his fee; and this is made
to include any breakage he may cause. It will insure
him, also, against any claim from a third party&mdash;from
anyone, that is to say, who might be injured in some
mishap for which he was responsible. This inclusive
fee for learning to fly, at the principal schools to-day,
is represented by a sum of £75; and the pupils who are
most numerous are naval and military officers, who go
through their course of training so as to become eligible
for the Government air service. There is, and always
will be, a constant demand for such pilots. At present,
having regard to the strain which is incurred by flying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
war machines, a naval or military airman is relieved
from active duty after a period of four years. Then he
may join a reserve or&mdash;as is now proposed&mdash;continue in
the less nerve-trying work of handling airships. Regular
air service, in either the Navy or Army, is reckoned more
exacting than ordinary flying, and for the reason that&mdash;say
when upon man&#339;uvres or special tests&mdash;the pilot of
war-craft may have to make long flights in treacherous,
blustering winds. Frequently, after he has risen upon
some special flight on a stormy day, the force of the
wind may so increase that a pilot runs the gravest
of risks when he seeks to alight. While upon one of
his trials, for instance, with a Government-built biplane,
a military airman found that the wind had risen suddenly
from 30 or 40 miles an hour until it was blowing
at more than 70. His machine, although a fast one,
was blown to a standstill and occasionally forced backwards;
and he fought the wind for more than an hour,
creeping cautiously nearer the earth, before he could
seize upon a lull and make his landing. Another pilot&mdash;this
was in the days before &#8220;looping the loop&#8221;&mdash;was
blown completely over by a fierce rush of wind, and
descended upside down for more than a thousand feet&mdash;clinging
grimly to his machine, and escaping injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Naval and military airmen predominate at the schools;
but there are many civilians, also, who come to learn to
fly. Some of them, after they are skilled, become
professional pilots, being employed by an aeroplane
company to demonstrate its machines: others, having
money to invest, will buy one or two craft and start a
flying school of their own; others again, after purchasing
a machine, will take it abroad with them and give
exhibition flights, visiting places if possible where
aviation has not been seen before. Some men,
adopting this plan in early days, had experiences which
were the reverse of pleasant. High winds blew occasionally,
thus preventing them from flying upon the day
arranged; whereupon the spectators, having come long
distances perhaps to see a man ascend, were so furious
at their disappointment that they broke from their
enclosures and wrecked the aeroplane in its tent. It
happened sometimes, too, that a man&mdash;rendered foolhardy
by the clamour of a crowd&mdash;would ascend when
conditions were dangerous, and be blown to the ground
and killed. But large sums of money were to be made
by demonstration flights, and so pilots were found ready
to run grave risks&mdash;ascending often from cramped and
awkward grounds, and making flights over localities
upon which, had their motors failed, they would have
found no safe alighting point.</p>

<p>Among those who meet at a flying school&mdash;instructors,
pupils, and mechanics&mdash;there is a feeling of friendly
regard; and most men, after they have learned to
fly, look back upon their training with a feeling of
regret that it is ended. There is good fellowship in
the adventures of the day&mdash;much laughter, too, at
the mistakes which are made; and some of them,
without doubt, prove distinctly amusing. It happens
occasionally, for instance, that a pupil will, after
being given control of a machine for the first time,
lose his head completely in a panic, and do just the
things which he has been instructed to avoid. In
gliding down from a flight, for instance, the engine
should be switched off; but sometimes the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
novice&mdash;engrossed by his movements of the elevating lever&mdash;will
forget all about his motor. Descending at a
tremendous pace, and with the engine still running, he
will strike the ground with a crash and crumple up his
chassis; and then no one is more surprised than he is
at what has occurred. It may happen also that a novice,
when he is merely running a machine across the ground,
will be seized by panic, or some form of mental
paralysis. Perhaps he may fail to shift his rudder and
so collide with some obstruction or another machine; or
he may&mdash;as was the case with one pupil at a well-known
school&mdash;simply sit helpless in his seat and allow his
craft, with its motor running at full speed, to charge
pell-mell into the fence which bordered the aerodrome.
Then, standing up in the wrecked machine, and staring
blankly at those who ran to him, he confessed that he
had forgotten, utterly, each and all of the things he
should have done.</p>

<p>There is an unconscious humour sometimes
in a pupil&#8217;s remark after he has met with a mishap. One,
attempting too steep a turn, side-slipped and fell with a
crash, wrecking his machine completely. The instructor
hurried to the spot, fearing he might be hurt; but he
scrambled from the wreckage without a scratch. Then
walking up to the instructor, he observed very gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, I&#8217;m so sorry: I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve damaged your machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was in the early days, more than at
the present time, that learning to fly proved an adventure.
Now it is a business, and one conducted so admirably
that a pupil passes from stage to stage with a real
pleasure. He knows, before he begins his tuition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
exactly what his fee will be. If he wrecks an aeroplane,
if he knocks a hole in the side of a shed, if he rushes
full-tilt into another machine&mdash;all such misdemeanours
mean nothing to him financially. But it should be
mentioned, incidentally, that such wild deeds are mostly
things of the past; such exploits, for instance, of that of
the happy-go-lucky pupil who, after insisting upon being
allowed to use a craft with an abnormally powerful
motor, sprang into the air at his first attempt, and flew
for nearly a mile in a wavering flight&mdash;landing eventually,
strange to say, without in any way damaging himself
or his machine. Experience now proves so valuable
in the art of learning to fly, that even a clumsy pupil
is safeguarded from accident. A serious mishap
at a flying school is very rare. There are small
breakages, of course; but any injury to pupil, or to anyone
else connected with the school, is most satisfactorily
averted: and this safety is gained by so carefully
planning his course of instruction that the novice is
doing always something that is well within his powers.</p>

<p>Matters were entirely different in the pioneer
days; then a man was given a machine, after a little preliminary
tuition, and allowed to do pretty much as he
liked&mdash;with results, as may be imagined, which were
sometimes remarkable. At one of the French schools,
after making a short flight in a monoplane, a novice
sprang from his machine before it had come to a standstill,
and with his motor still running, although he had
throttled it down. His idea was to bring the craft to a
temporary halt by holding it back, and then to turn it
round by swinging its tail&mdash;and with its engine still in
operation&mdash;so that he might leap in again and fly back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
across the aerodrome. This daring man&#339;uvre, attempted
because he had not as yet mastered the trick of circling
while in the machine, was quite successful up to a point.
Unfortunately, however, while holding to the side of the
hull, and digging his heels into the ground to check the
momentum of the craft, the pupil happened to push over
the lever which controlled the motor. Accelerating
rapidly, the engine drew forward the monoplane with a
jerk; the pupil was thrown from his feet and fell prone,
and the machine, without a guiding hand upon its levers,
rushed across the ground and then rose into the air.
An extraordinary flight it made, watched breathlessly by
those who stood upon the aerodrome; first upwards,
then downwards, and then sideways, until finally, losing
its balance in a wavering turn, it fell with a crash and
was destroyed.</p>

<p class="space-below1">The first thing one must do in learning
to fly, is to become familiar with the position and movements of the
levers of a machine; and these, as we have explained,
are simple. Experience, indeed, after one method and
another has been tried, has brought all systems so that
they bear a resemblance to each other. In one machine
a hand-wheel may be employed, in another perhaps
a lever; but the idea underlying all of them is the
same. It is that a pilot&#8217;s actions, while he balances
his craft, should be natural and instinctive&mdash;that his
lever should swing in the direction he would turn, were
he controlling his machine by a movement of the body.
Upon a typical school biplane, such as a pupil learns
first to fly, he has only two levers with which he need
concern himself. One, which he holds in his right hand,
controls the rising and alighting and the balance of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
machine; the other, which is in the form of a bar upon
which he rests his feet, swings the rudder and steers
him from side to side. There are, in addition, convenient
to his left hand, the switch and small throttle-lever
which operate the motor. The simplicity of the
control is shown by <a href="#Fig_94">Fig. 94</a>. What the pupil does&mdash;as
a first stage in his tuition&mdash;is to seat himself in the
machine, while it stands at rest on the ground, and
move the levers so that he becomes accustomed to their action.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_94" id="Fig_94"></a>
  <img src="images/figure94.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="405" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Control of a School Biplane.</p>
</div>

<p>After this, taking his turn one morning with
others who are at the school, he seats himself behind the
instructor and is borne into the air upon his first flight.
In this&mdash;and in several subsequent ascents&mdash;he does
nothing himself; he is merely a passenger. From his
position behind the pilot, however, he can watch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
former&#8217;s movement of the levers as he rises, turns in the
air, or descends; and this gives the pupil an idea as to
how far and how quickly a lever must be shifted to gain
a controlling effect. He sees that delicacy is required,
chiefly, in the handling of an aeroplane; and it surprises
him to observe that a movement of a few inches one
way or another is all the pilot need make with his lever.
Apart from watching such controlling actions he becomes
accustomed, in these trial flights, to the sensation of
being in the air. It is necessary above all else, that he
should learn to feel at home in an aircraft, and not be
flurried by the speed at which it passes through the air,
or by the strangeness of looking downward upon the
ground from a machine in flight. It is important, too,
that he should learn to gauge distances and speed.
These, when an aeroplane is in question, are apt to
prove deceiving; it is very necessary, for instance, that
the novice should be able to estimate how far his craft
will travel in a descent, after he has stopped his engine
and is gliding, before it comes in contact with the ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes, through a failure to judge correctly
what distance his machine will glide before alighting,
a pupil may find himself in an awkward position.
In one case, for example, switching off his motor
while some distance above the sheds at an aerodrome,
the novice began to plane down, intending to land
in the centre of the ground. But he found as he
descended that he had misjudged his height, and
was likely to over-shoot the mark. He steepened
the glide, but it was of no avail; his machine had
been much higher, when he stopped his motor, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
he had imagined; and now, instead of alighting where
he had planned, he found himself sweeping rapidly
across the aerodrome, still some distance from the
ground, and with trees and other obstructions looming
before him. Down he came till he was about 30 feet
from the grass; but his craft&mdash;being a biplane and
lightly loaded&mdash;seemed almost to resist his efforts to
bring it to earth, and still skimmed through the air
in a graceful glide. He saw now that he could not
land in time&mdash;that, even if he managed to touch
ground before reaching the end of the aerodrome,
his craft would run on, by reason of its impetus, and
collide with a fence and trees. There seemed only
one thing to do&mdash;start the motor again, rise above
the trees, and circle round and attempt another
landing. But then the pupil&mdash;still sweeping nearer
danger&mdash;had an unpleasant surprise: the engine, when
he turned the switch, refused for some reason to start.
He fumbled for a second or so, but it was no good;
and now he was rushing upon the trees. Swinging
his rudder in a panic, he attempted to turn. But the
pace of the machine had lessened; and, there being no
motive-power behind it, the abruptness of the turn
robbed it suddenly of its forward speed. It wavered,
came to a standstill in the air, and then side-slipped
heavily, falling upon one wing-tip, and becoming an
almost total wreck. But the pupil, although shaken,
was not injured.</p>

<p>A novice, in landing from a flight, has
not only to gauge just where his machine will touch ground,
but must estimate also how far the craft will roll
upon its running wheels before it comes finally to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
standstill. One beginner, alighting correctly but rather
too near the rails of an aerodrome, found that his
machine ran forward till it struck them, and then
turned a somersault, pinning him down within his
machine, but not causing him any injury. On some
aircraft nowadays, so as to control this movement
over the ground after alighting, a form of brake is
fitted between the landing-wheels, which can be lowered
by the pilot from his seat, and digs a steel prong
into the ground, bringing a powerful checking influence
upon the machine. A device of this kind is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>. Such a means of stopping a machine
is often very necessary, particularly in cross-country flying, for a
pilot may land, say, upon a sloping field, and find that his craft
is running downhill quite beyond his control, and
threatening to collide either with a wall or fence.</p>

</div>

<p>After he has flown several times as a passenger,
and watched all that his instructor does while in the
air, the pupil reaches the second stage of his tuition;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and in this he is seated alone in a machine, and
allowed to drive it here and there across the aerodrome.
The biplane is adjusted, as a rule, so that
it will not fly; and this process of the training&mdash;which
is called &#8220;rolling&#8221; at the schools&mdash;is to
enable a novice to handle his craft neatly while on the
ground, to learn to steer to right or left, to keep it
when necessary upon a straight course, and to accustom
himself to the starting and stopping and control of his
engine. This practice is important. With his motor
giving just sufficient power to make the controls of
the machine effective, but not enough to lift it into
the air, the pupil &#8220;rolls&#8221; from one side of
the aerodrome to the other; then he turns by a movement
of his rudder, which swings the tail of the machine,
and returns again to his starting-point, striving always
to keep his craft from swinging sideways. He finds,
while making these long, straight runs, that the
machine shows a tendency, if the controls are untouched,
to swerve a little to the left; and this is
caused by the influence of the propeller, which is
revolving to the left. But the inclination may be checked
quite easily by a movement of the rudder to the right.</p>

<p>With a school biplane, adapted for its
work, a novice may soon learn to steer while on the ground;
but with some other types of machine&mdash;notably a
fast monoplane&mdash;&#8220;rolling&#8221; is by no means
easy. A racing craft, for instance, when it is moving across
the aerodrome, needs most expert handling: even the
smallest error of judgment in the use of the rudder
may send it whirling round upon itself in a violent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
turn&mdash;rather like an angry bird; while if the pilot
attempts to swerve too abruptly, in avoiding any
obstacle before him, the machine may reel sideways
and overturn&mdash;and, seeing that it is travelling at a
speed greater than that of an express, the resulting
smash may be a serious one.</p>

<p class="space-below2">&#8220;Rolling&#8221; accomplished, and a facility
gained with his control levers, the pupil is subjected to his first
real test. Again alone in the machine, and with the
instructor watching him from the sheds, he attempts
a short, straight flight. There is nothing ambitious
about this journey through the air; those on the aerodrome,
in fact, call it a &#8220;hop.&#8221; What the pupil does
is to accelerate his motor, attain a flying speed, and
very cautiously move his elevator until he is skimming
through the air a few feet above the ground. Then,
after flying a short distance in this way, he pushes
forward his lever and descends. He attempts no
turns; rises no height in the air; the idea, indeed,
is to learn the art of ascending and alighting with
the least possible risk. Occasionally, and more often
in the early days, a novice has shown an abnormal
skill. One, ascending for the first time and ignoring
the advice of his instructor, passed straight away from
the aerodrome, rising as he flew, and disappeared
above a clump of trees, his landing wheels almost
brushing their tops. His instructor, and the officials
of the ground, were naturally perturbed; particularly
when, a minute or so later, the pupil was seen to be
returning towards the aerodrome, flying now so low
that he could not hope to clear the trees. Towards
them he came, making no attempt to turn, and those
who watched feared a fatal smash. But then an extraordinary
thing happened. Despite the fact that he
was an utter novice, and had made no flight like
this before, the pupil steered coolly for a gap between
two trees, and although there was barely room for
his wing-tips, and he actually brushed against the
branches upon one side, he managed to pass through
safely and landed upon the aerodrome without
mishap. When the instructor and others came over
to him, expressing their astonishment, he appeared
surprised that his performance should have provoked
comment. Quite calm and unmoved, he seemed to
think he had done nothing at all peculiar; although,
as a matter of fact, such a flight between two trees&mdash;with
practically no margin for error&mdash;would have
been a feat considered perilous even by an experienced airman.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Once he can make a short, straight flight
and land neatly, the pupil is ready to attempt a turn while in the
air. A half-turn to the left is first essayed, and for the
reason that it is more easily accomplished than a swing
to the right. This is due to the fact that the engine and
propeller, revolving to the left, tend naturally to incline
a craft in that direction. The pupil finds as he turns
that he must&mdash;in addition to putting over the rudder&mdash;move
the ailerons at his wing-tips; and he needs to
make this movement because the biplane, while it is in
the act of swinging, begins to heel inwards. The outer
plane-ends of a machine, when it is forced thus upon a
turn, have indeed a natural inclination to &#8220;bank,&#8221;
or rise. This is because, as the craft swings, the outer
wing-tips move more rapidly through the air than do
those upon the inside of the turn; they exercise, for
the moment, therefore, a greater lifting power; and
the result is that, with this sudden and extra &#8220;lift,&#8221;
they force up the outer side of the machine. On a
very rapid turn, if this movement went unchecked, a
machine might heel to such an angle that it slipped
inwards and fell to the ground; but there is no fear of
this if the pilot, moving over his hand-lever, draws at
the ailerons upon the side of the craft that is tilting
down. This causes the plane-ends to rise, and the
machine swings upon a normal path. <a href="#Fig_96">Fig. 96</a>
shows a school biplane making a &#8220;banked&#8221; turn. A certain
amount of &#8220;banking&#8221; is necessary when turning; it
helps a craft to incline smoothly and prevents it from
skidding outwards, as it might do were its planes not
heeling to the swing. Any pronounced degree of &#8220;banking&#8221;
must not, however, be indulged in by a pupil. In
even an acute &#8220;bank,&#8221; to a skilled pilot, there is no
element of risk; experience has told him, in a way
nothing else could, just what angle may be safe, or what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
not; but the beginner, remembering that any steep
inclination of his planes may cause a side-slip, must not
venture so to heel his craft. Sometimes, becoming over-bold,
a novice may &#8220;bank&#8221; steeply once or twice
without mishap; but then perhaps, while attempting to
repeat the man&#339;uvre he had made before, he may
pass without knowing it over the danger-line, and find
his craft slipping helplessly beneath him. If flying
quite near the ground, as probably he will be, the mishap
may mean a crumpled wing and nothing worse;
and it will serve the purpose of teaching him a greater caution.</p>

  <p class="blockquot space-below2">A.A. Represent the ailerons, which are drawn down by the pilot to
prevent the machine from heeling too far inwards.</p>
</div>

<p>Although, under favourable conditions, a modern
machine requires little control, and though he meets with
few difficulties when he is learning to fly, a pupil must
remember always that no liberties can be taken while he
is in the air; every instant he is aloft he needs caution.
The greatest of the world&#8217;s airmen&mdash;the Wrights, say,
or Bleriot or Farman&mdash;never lost for one moment what
may be termed their respect for the air. A man who is
haphazard or careless should not turn to aviation; he is
a danger to himself, and to others also.</p>

<p>After making turns to the left, until he can accomplish
them with ease, the novice attempts a similar man&#339;uvre
to the right; but he needs to remember, while at this
stage of his tuition, that a turn must never be attempted
while a machine is ascending. If this mistake is made,
and a craft is swung sideways while its planes are inclined
at a steep angle to the air, it may lose its forward speed
and slide tail-first towards the ground.</p>

<p>When turning to the right, as soon as he attempts
this man&#339;uvre, the pupil finds that his craft has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
tendency to rise: this is due to the gyroscopic effect of
engine and propeller, which are revolving in the opposite
direction to the turn. To counteract the influence, however,
which is slight, the pilot should move his elevator
so that it is in the position for a descent. The machine,
if he does this, will resist the gyroscopic motion and
maintain an even keel. In early days, when little was
known about this gyroscopic influence, a turn to the
right was considered difficult and even dangerous, and
there were men who would not attempt it if they could
avoid doing so. But nowadays, thanks to greater
knowledge and experience, the right-hand turn proves
as easy almost as a similar movement to the left.</p>

<p>Reaching the stage when he can turn with facility
either right or left, the pupil combines these man&#339;uvres
in a single flight, and learns also to stop his motor while
in the air and descend in a glide. The point to be
remembered in making a <i>vol-plané</i> is that, when its motor
is stopped, the only force which keeps an aeroplane
moving is that of gravity. If it stands still in the
air its planes are inoperative, and it falls. So, as he
switches off the motor, the airman must push forward
his elevating lever, tilt down the front of his machine,
and set it gliding earthward; and, if the speed of his glide
is maintained, the craft is perfectly controllable. The
actual landing is a matter of skill. Just before his craft
touches ground, the novice must tilt back his elevating
plane; this checks the glide, raises the front of the
machine, and brings his wheels into a smooth contact
with the ground. Should such a checking movement
not be made&mdash;and some nervous pupils have been known
to forget it&mdash;a machine may strike ground sharply, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
an awkward angle, and damage its chassis. The landing-gear
of a school biplane is, however, made specially
strong, and will resist a heavy shock.</p>

<p>Now the pupil is ready for his official tests.
These are conducted by the Royal Aero Club, which has
officials at the aerodrome. Two posts are fixed in the
ground, not more than 500 metres (547 yards) apart,
and round these the pupil must fly, altering the direction
of his flight at each turn, so that he is making in the air
a series of figures of eight. Two such flights is he called
upon to make, each of a distance of 5 kilometres
(3 miles 185 yards); and he is asked also to ascend 100
metres (328 feet), and from this altitude descend with his
motor stopped. In alighting from each of his tests the
pupil must, so as to show his judgment of distance and
speed, bring his machine to rest within 160 feet of a
mark upon the aerodrome that is indicated to him.
The representatives of the Aero Club, when these trials
are completed, send to headquarters their official report;
and the committee of the club, after considering this and
finding it in order, issues to the pupil a numbered
certificate, which contains his photograph for purposes
of identification and a printed list of the rules which, as
a duly qualified pilot, he must now observe. Once he
has gained his certificate&mdash;or &#8220;ticket&#8221; as it is
called at the aerodrome&mdash;the pupil ceases indeed to be a novice,
the period of his tuition ends, and he becomes entitled to
take part in the races at Hendon, or in any other contests
that may be organised under the jurisdiction of the Club.</p>

<p>Naturally, even when he has gained his certificate,
the pilot has much to learn. The passing of his tests
does not imply, for instance, that he is a flyer of experience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
able to grapple instantly with any difficulty that
may arise. What the granting of his certificate does
actually show, is that he has learned how to handle an
aeroplane, and may be relied upon to make no elementary
mistakes. The art of cross-country flying is still a
closed book to him; and to this, as a rule, he next turns
his attention, first making short trips near the aerodrome,
and then increasing gradually the length and boldness
of his flights. Then he must learn to combat a wind,
and to steer by his maps and compass; he must, in fact,
teach himself to be an all-round man. And none of
these stages must be gone through hurriedly. In
aviation, more than in any other art in the world, the
whole of a man&#8217;s knowledge must be dependable and sound.

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <small>TOURING BY AIR</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">Machines and alighting grounds&mdash;The cost of
flying&mdash;An imaginary tour&mdash;The sensations of a passenger&mdash;How laws
will be framed to govern flight&mdash;Aerial smugglers and spies.</p>

<p>The joys of aerial touring are such that it is
difficult to do them justice. Free from the earth and its obstructions,
free from police traps and dust, and the noise and traffic
of the roads, the aerial tourist wings his way&mdash;serenely
and with ease, a panorama spread below and upon either
hand, and with a wine-like freshness in the air. Who
would be chained to a road, winding here and there, when
he might pass high above the earth upon the aerial highway?
The day is already dawning when, housing his aircraft
say at Hendon as a convenient starting-point, the
most modern of travellers will tour regularly by air, using
a plane as he would a motor-car, and throwing himself
with zest into the new amusement that is offered him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>Prejudices of course die hard; there are
still the occasional accidents which are reported in the daily
press; still there is the lurking notion that because a
flying craft passes through the air and not upon the
ground, it can <i>never</i> be safe. But facts must speak, and
are speaking; and daily, and almost hourly, this mountain
of prejudice is being moved. For every mishap that
happens men are now flying many thousands of miles,
and flying not only in safety, but with comfort and
pleasure. Nor do craft any longer collapse while in the
air, nor motors fail constantly; nor does the wind hold
those terrors that it did at first. Touring aircraft that are
both scientific and airworthy may be obtained, and as a
practical means of transit from point to point&mdash;speedier and
more pleasant than the motor-car&mdash;the aeroplane now finds
frequent use. The pleasure use of planes is encouraged, also, by
their growing comfort. Pilots and passengers sat formerly upon bare,
open seats exposed to the rush of air: but a modern touring
craft has a neatly enclosed body, like that of a motor-car
with padded seats, and screens to protect its occupants
from the rush of wind. How snug it is within the hull
of a latest-type machine may be seen from <a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>.
Of course the air tourist, like the motorist, needs some
objective for his day&#8217;s journey&mdash;some place to which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
may fly and alight, and at which he may house his
machine; and here and there even to-day, at the dozen
or more flying grounds dotted about England, such
facilities may be found; even, for instance, at Lanark, in
far-off Scotland. But France is still greatly ahead of us
in this respect&mdash;and Germany too: they have, already, a
very large number of air-stations, and are adding to them
rapidly. All that is needed, to form an alighting spot,
is a suitable stretch of open land with some sheds, a
repair shop, a telephone, and one or two mechanics in
attendance. The establishment of such landing grounds
for the aerial tourist, which would correspond to the
halts of the motorist, will form one of the next great
developments of flying. Like stations on a railway, or
garages upon a main road, will be the landing-points for
aeroplanes; no growth in touring can be expected without them.</p>

</div>

<p>It is not so expensive as some might imagine
to tour by air. A man may, for an expenditure of £1200,
buy a two-seated 80-h.p. monoplane, or a biplane
seating three people; and the running expenses, for such
craft as these, should represent a figure of about 5-1/2d.
per mile. Then upon a tour, say, of three months,
covering a distance of 4000 miles, there would be
incidental expenses to reckon with, as follows: £36
for the services of a mechanic; £12 for garaging;
£50 for repairs; and £10 as insurance against any third-party
risks. In the future, of course, when machines are
built in large numbers, and standardised in their output
like cars, the cost of flying will be reduced greatly; but
even to-day, with aerial touring in its infancy, a man
need not be a millionaire to enjoy it. And one must,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
when cost is being considered, remember the sheer thrill
that is experienced by the man who flies, and the
invigoration of the air, say, at 3000 feet, which acts as a
pure, splendid tonic for those who have jaded nerves.
There is, too, the wonderful bird&#8217;s-eye view which may
be obtained by those in an aeroplane. They see the
land below them, stretching for mile after mile till it is
shrouded in delicate mist; moving away slowly, appearing
far-distant and quite remote, and yet revealed in all its
detail&mdash;roads seem like ribbons, railways like tiny
glistening threads, and rivers and lakes shining mirror-like.
The day will soon dawn upon which, secure from
any haunting fear of accident, the tourist will sweep up
in his machine at Hendon, sail smoothly to the sea-coast,
thence to some beauty spot inland, and so on till he has
toured the kingdom.</p>

<p>Already, granted he has a suitable machine,
a man may roam the air pleasantly in England; and it may
prove of interest to picture such a tour&mdash;with the airmen
leaving Hendon early, just as the first summer&#8217;s mist
has gone, and the sun is mounting to another glorious
day. There are, let us say, three of you in the party;
and you are ready, after a cup of hot and welcome
coffee, to take your seats within the machine&mdash;which
stands waiting upon the grass, its planes glinting in
the sun. Mechanics have appeared from the sheds
as your motor-car approached, and the pilot of the
machine, wearing his flying garb, has come forward with
a greeting; and now, while you are finishing your coffee,
the mechanics have filled the fuel tanks and, under the
supervision of the pilot, given a final glance here and there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; the airman questions; then with a smile
he orders: &#8220;all aboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>You climb up into the hull of the craft, and
find yourselves in neat, armchair seats, which prove extremely
comfortable. Then, after a final word to the mechanics,
the pilot mounts to his place before you&mdash;his driving-seat
being in the bow of the machine.</p>

<p>Now he calls an order, and the mechanics walk
behind the machine; then, breaking upon the stillness of the
morning, comes the roar of the motor. You feel the
machine strain suddenly forward; but it is held back;
and for a moment or so there is nothing but the harsh
clamour of the engine. Then, watching the pilot, you
see him turn slightly in his seat and raise an arm; and
at the same instant there is a movement of the craft.
You glance over the side of the hull, and see that the
ground has begun to race away sternwards. The swift,
steady forward impulse continues; there is a rush of
wind past the hull; and then, the transition from earth
to air being so gentle that it is imperceptible, and before
your senses can register an impression, the machine has
glided free of the ground, and is in actual flight. It is
not until your eyes, still turned downward, see that the
aerodrome with its sheds has begun to sink away below,
that you realise you are in the air. <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate XV</a>
shows how people who may be waving you farewell, appear when
viewed from an aircraft that is ascending.</p>

<p class="space-below2">Down, as though drawn by some giant,
unseen hand, sinks the surface of the land; and you yourself, save
for the wind which comes whistling past the hull, might be
suspended motionless in the air. Smooth, seemingly
quite effortless, is the progress of the machine; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
air aloft is&mdash;well, such air as, for sheer exhilaration, you
have never breathed before; and, although it has an
early-morning chill, you are shielded by the snug,
covered-in body of your craft. The machine as it thrusts
its way forward, is rising steadily&mdash;now 500, now 1000
feet; and as you fix your eyes again upon the pilot, you
see that he is making a turn. He is in fact swinging
his craft so as to steer for Kempton Park, where a tall
chimney forms a landmark for many miles; and the
reason for the man&#339;uvre is this: you are bound, as a
first flight, for the aerodrome by the sea which has been
established at Shoreham; but to fly there straight from
Hendon would mean passing above London, and this
by aerial law is not allowed. For the safety of the
public, indeed, all flights over towns are prohibited, it
being held that there might be danger, for those below,
from the fall or collapse of a machine. So pilots make
detours round areas that are populated; and your steersman,
having no desire to infringe the rules, points his
bow south-west and soon covers the fourteen miles to
Kempton Park. Round the chimney to which he has
been flying you make your turn; then he corrects his
course due south and steers steadily for the sea-coast,
still rising gently; while around and below&mdash;like a scene
from fairyland&mdash;lies the panorama of the landscape.</p>

  <p class="center">PLATE XVI.&mdash;THE GRAHAME-WHITE <i>AEROBUS</i>.</p>
  <p class="blockquot space-below1">
This machine, which is seen above with Mr. Grahame-White at the
steering wheel, holds a world&#8217;s record for weight-lifting,
having flown for 19 minutes at Hendon, carrying nine passengers.
The craft has a wing-span of 60 feet, and is driven by a motor
of 100 horse-power.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
A flight of 40 miles now lies before you. The
motor throbs rhythmically, the altitude is 3000 feet, and
your craft sways a little sometimes, ever so slightly, as
it encounters a gust of wind. Below lies Surrey, with
its commons, parks, and woods; and the effect of your
height is now peculiar. You have a fixed delusion that
the aeroplane is standing still, and that you are moving
neither forward nor sideways; and yet your speed, as a
matter of fact, is more than 50 miles an hour, and the
sea-coast creeps nearer mile by mile. This illusion, this
strong belief that you are motionless, is due to your
height above the ground. Looking down upon the
earth, from an altitude of several thousand feet, you
have no near object by which you can gauge your speed.
It is the same when one glances from the window of an
express, and catches sight of some distant hill. Even
in a train running at sixty miles an hour, if you watch a
landmark that is remote, it will seem that your pace is
slow; and yet if you note the telegraph poles close
beside the track, you see that they are flying past your
carriage window.</p>

<p>Soon, after peering steadily ahead, your pilot
turns towards you with a call: &#8220;Look&mdash;the sea!&#8221;</p>

<p>Your eyes follow the direction of his outstretched
arm, and there, faint upon the sky-line but quite distinct,
and reflecting the glint of the sun, lie the waters of the
Channel. The land at its brink is only dimly visible at
first: there is a slight sea-mist; but soon, as your craft
speeds closer, the wide sweep of the coast is open to your
view. Westward lies Selsey Bill, at the extremity of a
stretch of shore which juts boldly to the sea; and then
from west to east, as you turn your head, you follow the
line of the coast until Beachy Head, standing clear-cut
and distinct, caps to the eastward this fine-drawn curve.
You call an inquiry, and your pilot points ahead: almost
in the centre of the bay, at a point where a glint of
water, seen a little way inland, reveals the location of
Shoreham Harbour, lies the aerodrome that is your goal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

  <p class="center space-below1"><span class="smcap">Fig. 98.</span>&mdash;Hendon to Shoreham, 55 miles.</p>
</div>

<p>Quite soon, still driven smoothly by your motor,
you hover above the alighting point; and then moving over
a little switch upon the dashboard before him, the
airman cuts off his power. The booming drone of the
engine dies away, and at the same moment you feel
the craft tilt forward, and see the aerodrome below, fringed
by the roofs of its sheds. And, in the sudden stillness which
has fallen, you hear the wail of the wind, shrieking past your
struts and planes. Down quite gently glides the craft, and you
see a movement of little figures near some sheds; then you
touch ground without shock, and the machine runs forward
a short distance and halts. This stage of your flight is
shown in <a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>.</p>

<p>The pilot glances at a little clock that is fixed
on his dashboard; then stands up to stretch his limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just over an hour,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Not so bad. With
the 14 miles to Kempton Park and then the 41 here&mdash;that
makes 55. She&#8217;s been doing a steady 50 an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now a little group surrounds the machine,
and calls up questions about your flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a trip, old man?&#8221; queries a
brother pilot of the driver of your craft.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Is the wind steady up above?&#8221; asks a young man
in a flying helmet, who is one of the pupils of the flying school.</p>

<p>Answering the eager questioners as best you
can, you clamber down from the hull. Several aeroplanes,
you now observe, are out upon the aerodrome, and here
and there a novice is at work&mdash;either &#8220;rolling&#8221;
his craft to and fro, or attempting a short, straight flight;
and, even though it is still early, visitors may be seen
near the sheds; they have motored out from Brighton
to watch the practice flights.</p>

<p>But your chief concern, you find, is in the
matter of breakfast; the air has given you an appetite that will
not brook delay. A motor-car stands in readiness; so
you take your seats and drive into Brighton, where you
enjoy a leisurely meal. Then comes a drive along the
sea-front in the beauty of the morning sun: and after
this you return to the aerodrome, where the biplane
stands waiting for its second flight. You have decided&mdash;wishing
to remain by the sea&mdash;that you will fly on
along the coast to Eastbourne, where there is another
aerodrome at which you may alight. So, with a shout
of farewell ringing in your ears, the big machine sweeps
skyward&mdash;up swiftly and steadily, circling as she climbs;
and then your pilot turns eastward, and you fly above
the fringe of the sea. Along past Brighton the aircraft
makes her way, and you note the people on the beach&mdash;looking
no bigger than ants upon a path&mdash;as they stand
in little groups and watch your progress. High above
the piers the biplane flies, and you see the town lying
mapped away inland, with the electric railway skirting
the water&#8217;s edge. Then on swiftly, following the line
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of the cliffs, a cool sea-breeze beating into your face.
The earth below seems to fade into insignificance; far-distant,
skirting the brink of the cliffs like a thin, white
ribbon, you see a lonely road; and all the time, climbing
higher and higher through the sunshine, your pilot forces
his plane aloft Three thousand feet, four thousand feet&mdash;still
you ascend; and soon the needle of the height
recorder stands at 5000 feet. Newhaven is now below,
with its river winding away inland; and a superb view,
which includes water, sea, and land, is spread at your feet.</p>

<p class="space-below1">On you fly, with the machine swaying
a little every now and then, as it encounters such wind eddies as are
formed where sea meets land. With the heat increasing,
these aerial disturbances grow marked, and your pilot
swings more seaward, so as to avoid the influence of the
swirls which rise upward above the cliffs. Beachy Head
is quickly reached, with its lighthouse showing clearly.
Now your pilot turns north-east, and quite soon you are
over Eastbourne, and planing down to reach the flying
ground. This second stage of your tour is shown in
<a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>. Again, when you have alighted, there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
greeting from airmen and their friends; then, while you
examine some aeroplanes in their sheds, and discuss the
pleasures of your trip with those about you, the pilot
of your machine has made an overhaul and is ready
again to take the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

  <img src="images/figure99.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="310" />
  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 99.</span>&mdash;Shoreham to Eastbourne, 33 miles.</p>
</div>

<p>This time, still hugging the coast, you have
decided to fly to Dover. Here at Whitfield, a mile or two out
of the town, there is an excellent aerodrome, and the
flight from Eastbourne is one of 52 miles. But a point
to be remembered is that Dover, with its fortifications,
which might be spied from the air, has now been declared
out of bounds by aerial law, and no pilot&mdash;unless he
obtains a permit&mdash;is allowed to fly nearer than within
three miles of its castle. For a British aircraft, however,
when bent upon a pleasure tour, there should be no
difficulty in securing such an exemption as is required;
and we will assume you have been granted
one, and have a right to cross the harbour and pass
the castle on the hill. Rising quickly, therefore, and
with your motor running sweetly, you steer eastward
from the aerodrome, and are soon at Bexhill. This gives
place to Hastings as the coast sweeps below; and then
you see Dungeness, 15 miles ahead, jutting out upon the
sea. This reached, and left behind, and you have Dover
ahead, with not more than 20 miles to fly; and your
pilot, steering a course directly for his goal, takes you
out several miles to sea, so that you observe Romney
and Dymchurch lying away upon your left.</p>

<p>It is now that, turning a moment from his
control-wheel, the airman points south-east across the Channel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he calls; &#8220;France!&#8221;</p>

<p>Distinctly, indeed, away upon the sky-line, you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
see the outline of the French coast; and as you look, Cape Grisnez,
stretching its arm of land towards England, quite clearly takes the eye.</p>

<p class="space-below1">On, with the engine singing its sleepy
song, the biplane speeds; and when you glance earthward again
it is the Shakespeare Cliff that is passing away below;
then Dover, with its steamboat pier and harbour works,
lies directly beneath your feet. You see the square outline
of the harbour hotel, looking like a doll&#8217;s house
from some children&#8217;s game; and along a shining ribbon
of rail, with a tiny jet of steam behind it, a little toy
engine is busily shunting a miniature train. A second
or so later, and the noise of the motor has ceased;
then&mdash;rushing earthward in a long, swift, perfect glide&mdash;you
reach your landing at Whitfield, and another
stage, as seen in <a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>, has been accomplished safely.</p>

</div>

<p class="space-below1">At Dover, while resting and taking
a meal, you discuss your next flight; and it is decided to make
for Eastchurch, in the Isle of Sheppey, where there
is a busy and important aerodrome, and the naval airmen
have their school. This, as seen by <a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
represents a flight of only 27 miles. Away again,
therefore, and flying now inland, you pass Canterbury
and some belts of woodland: then, flying above
the river Swale, you find you are over Sheppey and
with Eastchurch right before you. Here, in the middle
of the sleepy little island, where an active colony of airmen
has been formed, the Royal Aero Club has its
flying ground; and it is here, too, that Messrs. Short
Brothers, after moving from Leysdown, a few miles
away, established an aeroplane factory in which&mdash;after
building Wright biplanes under licence from the famous
brothers&mdash;they developed those splendid sea-planes
which are used in the naval service.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 101.</span>&mdash;Dover to Eastchurch, 27 miles.</p>
</div>

<p class="space-below1">From Eastchurch, where there is much
to be seen, many routes may be chosen upon the aerial highway.
One may fly to Brooklands or Uphaven, to Farnborough
or Amesbury or Huntingdon. But you determine probably
that, returning to Hendon for the night, you will
house your aircraft there, and so be ready next day for
some other tour afield. Your course lies to East Tilbury,
a distance of 19 miles; then to Enfield, 25 miles&mdash;so as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to avoid passing above London; and thence, an 8-mile
stretch, steering W.S.W., to the landing ground at
Hendon. The route is shown in <a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a>. It
makes, in all, a flight of slightly more than 50 miles; and as it
necessitates crossing the Thames&mdash;a flight out of bounds
according to aerial law&mdash;you will need to have obtained
a permit, as was the case with your journey to Dover.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Fig_102" id="Fig_102"></a>
  <img src="images/figure102.jpg" alt="_" width="600" height="315" />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 102.</span>&mdash;Eastchurch to Hendon, 53 miles.</p>
</div>

<p>In the cool of the summer&#8217;s evening, refreshed
by a cup of tea, you leave Eastchurch behind you and set off
upon your final flight. Your course lies W.N.W., and
soon you pass from the island and have the waters of
the Medway below your feet. Then on again over land,
with the mouth of the Thames upon your right. East
Tilbury is now ahead, and you cross above the Thames,
with Gravesend to the left and a wide, open stretch of
river behind. Then with Essex beneath, and the river
still winding to his left, your pilot steers towards Enfield.
Soon the smoke of London looms in the distance to the
west, and you pass near districts where the houses stand
close-packed. Now Enfield is reached, and the steersman
makes his turn: then, ten minutes or so later, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
song of the engine is stilled; and in the gathering dusk&mdash;impressively
and without a sound&mdash;you begin your
downward glide. Round in a wide, smooth circle, and
with his planes &#8220;banked&#8221; steeply, does your pilot wheel.
Then you come finally to rest, and climb a little stiffly
from your seats: the day&#8217;s air-tour is done. Visiting
four aerodromes, three of them at the brink of the sea,
you have flown a total distance of just over 200 miles.</p>

<p>On another day, perhaps, you will fly to
Oxford; or tour above the West of England and alight at Filton,
near Bristol; here and there even now, at the grounds
dotted about the country, you will find facilities for landing.
Should there be no aerodrome near, and a descent
becomes inevitable, then your pilot must choose the best
field he can see, and alight in that: it is all part of the
adventure. Sometimes, certainly, a motor will fail in
awkward circumstances&mdash;say when a pilot is over wooded
or precipitous country. But with the airman, always, it
is a point of honour that he should see the humorous
side of things; and this gayness of outlook he will,
even under most trying circumstances, strive manfully
to maintain. Flying across country one day with a
passenger, a pilot heard a sound from his motor that
told him some valve or rod had broken; and the next
moment, without further warning, the engine stopped.
The wind at the time was gusty, and the ground below
unsuitable for landing; but the pilot remained unperturbed.
Perceiving beneath him an orchard, which
seemed to offer the least of many evils as an alighting
point, he leaned towards his passenger with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re fond of apples.&#8221;</p>

Landing areas for foreign aircraft.<br />The portions of the map shaded heavily in<br />

</div>

<p>So far, when he tours the air, a pilot has few restrictions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
He must not fly above certain areas, it is true,
but in the main the sky is free to him, and as yet he
need not register or number the craft he buys, like the
owner of a motor vehicle has to do. The fact is, however,
that laws for the air have been studied, and in
some cases a schedule prepared; but no definite scheme
of rules has, up to the present, been placed upon the
Statute books. The intention is, indeed, to allow the
science to develop with as few limitations as may be
possible. There are so many problems to be solved in
regard to the governing of flight, that they can only be
dealt with as they arise. The air, as an element in
which men may navigate a craft, has aspects which are
unique. Oceans and continents, for example, all have
their limitations: the land ends and the sea begins, and
then the sea in its turn gives place again to land. The
traveller from London, say, to Paris, first passing from
inland to the sea, has to leave the train and embark upon
a boat, only to change again into a train and finish his
journey&mdash;as he began&mdash;by way of the land. But an
aerial voyager between the two cities finds no restrictions
such as these: the air has only one boundary&mdash;the point
at which it touches the surface of the earth; and so he
may rise from London, and fly with equal facility above
land or sea.</p>

<p>Although the air has no limitations, such
as are encountered by land or sea, there has been discussion
between nations as to the rules they should impose to
control the flight of craft. It has been agreed, without
question, that the air-space over the high seas should
be regarded as free, and also above territory that is
unoccupied. The idea of an aerial law which is thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
most reasonable, indeed, is that the sky over the whole
globe should be declared free for traffic, but that each
nation should be allowed to enforce rules to prevent
attack or spying from above, and to check aerial
smuggling. But that flying over a frontier might be
controlled by a corps of aerial police is considered hardly feasible:
it would be almost impossible indeed&mdash;had he made up
his mind to do so&mdash;to prevent an airman from crossing
above some boundary. Even were there patrol craft
on duty, he could rise high among the clouds and so escape detection.</p>

<p class="space-below1">Such difficulties as these will, sooner or later,
have to be faced; but at present there are in existence only the simplest of
laws, and these have been framed for the safety of the public, and
to protect strategical areas from the attentions of foreign spies.
Flying over towns is&mdash;as has been stated&mdash;declared a
dangerous practice, and is no longer allowed; while the
officials of our Home Office, after consultation with the
naval and military authorities, have imposed restrictions
upon the entry into this country of foreign craft. A
machine reaching our shores from abroad can only land,

for instance, between the points specified below, and
outlined upon <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a>, and then only
after its pilot has given eighteen hours&#8217; notice to the Home Office,
either by letter or telegram, of his intended flight:<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="space-above1">It is declared unlawful for an aircraft
entering England from abroad to carry any goods upon which
Customs duty is payable, or the importation of which is
prohibited by law; any photographic apparatus, carrier
pigeons, explosives, or firearms, or any mails. Upon
arrival in one of the landing areas prescribed, the airman
fills up an official report, and obtains a permit
which allows him to continue his flight inland. Before
leaving the country, upon his return abroad, he must
alight in one of the coastal areas. No exemptions are
granted to these rules unless by the authority of the
Home Office, and no foreign naval and military aircraft
are permitted to fly over or land in England unless
upon a Government invitation.</p>

<p>A number of points in the United Kingdom
have been specified over which, for strategical reasons, no
flying is permitted&mdash;although such rules do not apply of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
course to British naval and military craft. The mouth
of the Thames is closed to aviation; fortifications like
those at Dover are declared out of bounds; also dock-yards
such as that at Portsmouth. The question arises
naturally: how are these rules to be enforced? What
is to prevent an aircraft infringing them? By the Act
of Parliament in which they are set forth, there is a
clause which reads:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;If an aircraft flies or attempts to fly over any area prescribed
under this Act for the purposes of the defence or safety of the
realm ... it shall be lawful for any officer designated for the
purpose by regulations made by the Secretary of State, to cause
such signal as may be prescribed by those regulations to be
given, and, if after such signal has been given the aircraft fails
to respond to the signal ... it shall be lawful for the officer to
fire at or into such aircraft, and to use any and every other
means necessary to compel compliance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Guns for use against aircraft have already
been placed around our coasts, and some of these would be
employed no doubt to fire upon a pilot who seemed
deliberately to break the law; but this assumes of
course that he is visible; were he flying very high, or
were clouds to obscure the view, he might defy the
officials who watched below. Just what may happen,
when such laws are required for daily use, time alone
will show; at present, beyond the bringing to our police
courts of certain foreign pilots who have flown above
prohibited areas on their way from France to Hendon,
no data is available; and these offending airmen, pleading
that they had no knowledge of the new laws, have
been treated leniently by magistrates.</p>

<p>The whole question of aerial law must be considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
seriously by the nations; and in view of the
preparation of some general code of rules the International
Aeronautical Federation&mdash;which is the central
authority upon aviation, and represents the world&#8217;s
Aero Clubs&mdash;has held many meetings and drafted
a number of proposals. It is held, to begin with,
that all aircraft must be registered, and that an
international list of machines must be compiled; also
that craft must be marked with letters indicating their
nationality&mdash;such as &#8220;G.B.&#8221; for Great Britain and
&#8220;F&#8221; for France. By such means, and particularly by use
of an international register, any craft could be identified,
even if flying in a foreign country; and should it escape
observation while in the air by flying high, it would
need ultimately to land, and would then have its
identity revealed. The pilot in charge would have
identification papers, and a certificate showing his
proficiency. The rules for obtaining such a certificate,
in days when men take charge of large passenger
machines, will need to be more exacting than they are
at the present time; and it is argued that, before he is
put in control of such a craft, an airman should pass a
medical examination so as to show he is organically
sound, and fit both in eyesight and nerve to steer a
high-speed, powerful machine.</p>

<p>When a craft is registered, and its pilot has his
certificate, it is considered necessary that&mdash;before he has
a right to fly&mdash;he should apply for an official form,
which would be known as a permit to travel. This
would contain all necessary details for the identification
of himself and his machine, and would allow him to fly
anywhere within his own country: but it would not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
available for an aerial tour abroad. He would be
required, before starting upon a foreign flight, to give up
this home permit, and obtain in place of it a special
Customs&#8217; bulletin. This would specify the nationality
of the machine, give particulars of its registration, and
provide details as to its passengers, goods, and
baggage; also the date and place of its departure from
England, with the destination to which it was bound.
On landing abroad, the airman would hand to the
authorities his bulletin, and receive in exchange a
document showing that the Customs&#8217; officers had
examined his machine and that he had paid what duty
might be claimed on any goods he carried; then, once
he had this new document, he would be free to fly in
the country visited.</p>

<p>It is in regard to the Customs that the
greatest problem must be faced. Rules may be made, alighting
points insisted upon, but how are aerial smugglers to be
caught? It has been suggested that there should be a
Customs&#8217; police, provided with fast-flying machines; also
that if a machine failed to descend when it ought, they
should go in chase of it. But in days when, without
once alighting, a flight of twenty-four hours will be easily
accomplished, such officers might find themselves upon a
wearisome pursuit; besides the probability that, either
during the night or in a fog, they would be given the
slip. Rendering easier aerial smuggling is the fact that,
to discharge a small cargo of contraband over a given
spot, the pilot need not alight. Fixing the package to
a parachute, he could cast it free from his machine and
continue swiftly upon his way&mdash;the parachute being
secured with its burden by the confederates who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
below. So difficult, in regard to aircraft, is this question
of applying the Customs, that it has been argued air-borne
traffic should&mdash;to save endless trouble and great
expense&mdash;be allowed to go duty free.</p>

<p>A matter which is easier, and for which
straightforward ruling may be framed, concerns the navigation
of craft upon the airway. At present, with comparatively
few machines, there is no great need for any code of
rules: one pilot, should he sight another, can easily
steer clear. But as the air becomes peopled, and
there are streams of traffic between landing grounds, it
will be very necessary to have a scheme of rules&mdash;rules,
say, for meeting and passing, and for flying by day or
night. What is suggested is that, with some modifications,
the laws of the sea should be adapted to the air.
Craft approaching each other should, it is held, bear
away to the right, and never pass nearer than 300
metres (328 yards). When flying at night, a system of
lights is recommended: white showing ahead, green to
starboard, red to port, and another white light astern.
Just before alighting when travelling by day, it is
suggested that a pilot should show a red triangular flag;
or, at night-time, wave a white light. When flying in
daylight, and finding himself in distress, it is advised
that a pilot should show a red triangular flag, and at the
same time suspend from his machine two black balls,
hung one above another; or, in the same circumstances
at night-time, wave a white lamp and extinguish his side
lights. The reason, in such a case, for extinguishing
the side lights would be so as to show to other pilots
only one lamp&mdash;the white one. This single white
light will be the night signal of an ordinary balloon, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
it will be the rule for all power-driven craft to make way
for it, and an aeroplane or an airship, say when its
machinery has broken down, being in the same position
as a free balloon, will wave this white-light signal so as
to warn other pilots to keep clear.</p>

<p>By degrees, as air-traffic grows, new laws
and regulations will need to be applied. But at present,
save for restrictions such as have been cited, an aerial
tourist wings unfettered flight. The motorist has a
speed limit of 20 miles; but the airman, 3000 feet aloft,
has none; and, save for certain areas out of bounds,
the sky is free wherever he may fly. Presently, however,
the law must have its say, and air transit will be
regulated as is the traffic of the land or sea. Already,
in fact, our Home Office, after consulting experts, has its
scheme of rules on paper; but these will not be enforced
till the need comes.

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <small>TWENTY YEARS HENCE</small></h2>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">The air, our future highway&mdash;Crossing the
Atlantic&mdash;New York, for the week-end, by flying Pullman&mdash;Mail-carrying
by air&mdash;The organisation of airways and air-stations.</p>

<p>It was in 1903 that the Wrights flew; and
after this there were some years of waiting: then, in 1909,
the world became aware that the air was conquered&mdash;not
a conquest complete and absolute, but the first fruits of
man&#8217;s victory. And now another five years have
elapsed, and men ascend in gales of wind, fly between
the capitals of Europe in a few hours, and travel 1000
miles without alighting. Above all, flying has been
rendered safe: with a sound machine to-day, and a
competent pilot, it is as safe in the air as it is on the
ground. So much for five years: but aeroplanes are
still small, and their engine-power is low; and airmen
may be likened perhaps to the first navigators of the sea.
They paddled tiny boats, and found they could control
them; then longed for larger craft, with which they
might cross the ocean, and bear passengers from land to
land. And the aviator, weary of such planes as he must
steer, longs also for a finer craft&mdash;larger, more powerful, capable
of carrying heavy loads, and of crossing the Atlantic in a day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The world&#8217;s demand is all for quicker transport;
yet, either by land or sea, the speed of travel has almost
reached its limit. To save a minute upon a time-table,
even with express trains, is now a problem; while with
a liner upon the sea, should a knot or so be gained, it is
only at an expenditure which is costly both of money
and of coal. But daily the cry is heard&mdash;speed, more
speed; time, which represents money, is growing always
more valuable. Men can speak to one another upon an
instant, by the use of the telephone, even when many
miles apart; they can flash messages across continents
by cable, or through the air by wireless waves; but
when they themselves seek to travel, or when they send
their goods from place to place, they must rely still upon
a train or steamer, and the best speed that these can
make. Larger sums of money would be earned if
passengers, letters, and merchandise could be moved
more quickly. Business men become irritable when on
long journeys, even in a 60-mile-an-hour dining-car train;
and from merchants there is the cry always that mail
services should be more rapid, and the transport of
goods speeded up. In meeting this demand for high-speed
transit lies the vast future of the aeroplane.
Along the highways of the air, thousands of feet aloft&mdash;above
mountains, forests, rivers, or seas&mdash;will pass the
high-speed traffic of the future. No rails or permanent
way need be built for the aeroplane; it provides its own.
All the air service requires, indeed, is a chain of landing stations.</p>

<p>Already, by aeroplane, a speed of 140 miles
an hour has been reached&mdash;more than two miles a minute;
and this represents no limit. Higher-powered engines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
are needed, and are now being built&mdash;although at the
present time a motor giving 200 h.p. is approximately
the best that can be obtained. What aeroplane constructors
hope to procure, as soon as engine makers
can provide them, are motors yielding thousands of
horse-power&mdash;similar to those which are available for
ships; and when such engines <i>are</i> produced, although
large sums must be expended upon their development,
the possibilities of aviation will be almost beyond
belief. Aeroplanes will leap in size from that of a
cockleshell to a liner; we shall have huge aerial vessels
which will carry hundreds of passengers; and within
twenty years&mdash;seated in comfortable, Pullman-car
saloons, 10,000 feet above the water&mdash;we shall be
crossing the wide Atlantic in less than twenty hours.
Already, as shown by the photograph on <a href="#PLATE_XVI">Plate XVI</a>,
it is possible to build a biplane which will carry
a crew of nine.</p>

<p>Air travel will have a luxury which is unknown
by land or sea. Machines will rush forward with a smooth,
vibrationless ease, and only the subdued hum from the
power-plant, and the hissing of air past the polished
hull, will indicate the speeds that are attained. In 1934,
leaving London say on Friday in the afternoon, one will
ascend in an air-liner and eat and sleep on board,
arriving at New York on Saturday morning. Then,
assuming you are a business man, and calls have been
made and your interviews done, you will leave New
York on Sunday afternoon and be in London again on
Monday morning. There will be no more inconvenience
in visiting America in the future, than there is
to-day in going to Scotland or spending a week-end in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Paris. Mr. Rudyard Kipling, picturing the coming of
this air age, has said:</p>

<p class="blockquot space-below1">
&#8220;The time is near when men will receive their normal
impressions of a new country suddenly and in plan, not slowly
and in perspective; when the most extreme distances will be
brought within the compass of one week&#8217;s&mdash;one hundred and
sixty-eight hours&mdash;travel; when the word inaccessible, as applied
to any given spot on the surface of the globe, will cease to have
any meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Problems, of course, have still to be solved;
but none are insurmountable or so difficult as was the initial
problem of making an aeroplane fly. Granted in due
course that greater engine-power will be obtained, a
problem outstanding concerns the wing area of a
machine. For bearing a heavy load, when a craft is
ascending and its speed is low, a large area is needed;
but once the machine is well aloft, has ceased climbing,
and is driving straight ahead, then its surface may be
curtailed. A bullet rushes through the air by its own
momentum; and with an aeroplane, as the speed grows
high, only a small wing area is required. If a craft
cannot curtail its surface, if it exposes when in full flight
just as much area as it used when climbing, then the
power of its motors is wasted and its efficiency impaired.
What is wanted for high-speed flight, and what time and
experiment should provide, is a method of reefing the
planes of a machine. This would mean that, rising
from the ground with its maximum surface, a machine
would telescope its plane-ends gradually when a height
had been reached, and continue so to reduce them until
there came a limit of speed. In this way, and with
multiple engines, a flying speed should be attained&mdash;even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
with large, heavily laden craft&mdash;of quite 200
miles an hour. Wind resistance, of course, will need to
be considered, and &#8220;stream-lining&#8221; brought to its
perfection. In the future, indeed, sloped delicately and
trimmed to their finest lines, the hulls of high-speed
craft should become pictures of grace.</p>

<p>In the carrying of mails, and for bearing
urgently-consigned goods, there will be another field for reliable,
fast-flying craft; and already, in actual tests which have
been made, the value of the air-mail has been demonstrated.
At Hendon, for instance, towards the end of
1911, an experiment was performed in which the Post
Office showed interest. The object was to carry special
letters and postcards, packed in ordinary mail-bags,
between the aerodrome and a landing ground at
Windsor; and in spite of bad weather, with treacherous
winds and rain, flights were made almost daily and at
high rates of speed. Letters and postcards borne thus
through the air had reached, when the experiment
ended, a total of 130,000. But before a public service
could be installed machines would need, of course, to be
reliable. They would be required to start punctually to
the minute and to fly day after day without mishap,
defying all weather save the worst of gales. And such
efficiency will in fact be reached: it is a question merely
of time. The aeroplanes used in this Hendon test were
small and of low power; hence, despite the courage and
experience of their pilots, they were at the mercy of
gusty winds. But the air-mail of the future&mdash;large,
metal-built, and driven by many motors&mdash;will thrust its
way, unscathed, into the teeth of a gale of wind.
Picture the start of such a craft, in the days when there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
is, say, an air-service between London and St.
Petersburg. The mail-bags are borne swiftly to the
aerodrome, and here stands the machine. Its widespread
sustaining planes are fashioned from plates of metal&mdash;a
metal light and yet amazingly strong; and between the
planes, with a wedge-shaped bow, lies the car or body of
the machine, with outlook windows along its front, and
doors upon either side. Behind the lifting wings there
are metal propellers; and sternwards the craft tapers
until it ends with the control planes and rudder. In the
hull, just behind the fore-car, men of the postal service
are busy with the storage of mails; then, when her load
is all aboard, appear the crew of three who are to voyage
through the air. First comes the air-mail driver; he is
in supreme control; and with him is a mechanic, a
highly skilled man, whose task it is to tend the motors
and see that they, and all the other working parts, are
running smoothly during the hours that the machine is
in flight. The third man to enter the fore-car is an
official of the Post Office, who travels in charge of the mails.</p>

<p>The sliding door in the hull is closed;
men step back away from the machine; and upon her controlling
platform the pilot, leaning forward slightly, pulls over a
lever. Instantly, as he does so, there comes a throb
and a hum; the engines wake to life and the big propellers,
flickering faster and faster, drive astern a screaming
gale of wind. Then, moving forward gracefully and
with quickly gathering speed, the air-mail rises and is
lost to view.</p>

<p>In the engine-car, the floor of which vibrates
very slightly with the hum of the motors and the rush of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
machine&#8217;s speed, stands the driver upon a raised platform.
Immediately before him, as the craft rises
slantingly, are the outlook windows; and convenient to
hand and eye, as he looks first ahead and then back to
his controls, are the wheels, levers, dials, and gauges by
which he governs all the movements of his swift-flying
charge. Bending forward, he moves his steering-wheel;
then watches attentively the needle of the compass,
which is fitted in an upright stand just before him.
Then from the compass dial he turns to a map, which
is stretched neatly upon a frame. Again he glances at
the compass; then straightens himself and turns to speak
to the mechanic. He has now adjusted the craft&#8217;s path,
and she is flying accurately upon her compass course.
After this, with an even, monotonous throb of sound,
and a faint clamour from the wind around the hull, the
craft rushes upon her way; and while the driver is
absorbed upon his platform the mechanic, moving deftly
here and there, tends the great, sleepily-humming motors.</p>

<p>Already, in the desire to build large, high-powered
machines, some remarkable craft have been produced;
and one of the most striking is the Sykorsky, a huge
and highly successful Russian biplane. This machine
has flown to a height of 3000 feet with sixteen passengers,
whose combined weight was nearly a ton and a quarter.
In its original form the machine had four motors, each
developing 100 horse-power, which were mounted on
the lower plane upon either side of the hull, one being
placed behind the other and all driving independent
screws. But the rear engines were afterwards brought
alongside the front ones; and now, in its most recent
form, the machine employs three motors, giving a total
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
of nearly 1000 horse-power. The craft has a metal hull,
and boasts a cabin with windows.</p>

<p>The fitting of several motors, a principle
tested in this biplane, has been shown to be practical; and it
has the obvious advantage that, should one fail while in the
air, the other or others will maintain a craft in flight.
In such a machine as would fly the Atlantic, for
example, it is proposed to fit four motors developing
800 h.p., and to carry a couple of mechanics who would
constantly be tending them. Thus, should one engine
develop trouble, its repair could be effected without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
descent, and with no worse result than a temporary fall
in speed. In <a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a> is shown a method
by which three Gnome motors may be fitted to a biplane.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p class="space-below1">First probably for mails, and after this
for passenger-carrying, will aeroplanes of the future be employed;
and they will find a scientific use, too, in exploring remote
corners of the earth, and in passing above forests which
are now impenetrable. Small, fast machines, much
cheaper than those of to-day, will be bought also for
private use&mdash;many of them, as suggested by <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>,
having room for only one man within their hulls. Then
there will be flying clubs; and to these, after their day&#8217;s
work, will come a city&#8217;s toilers. Through the cheapening
of craft, as time goes on, practically all members of the
community will experience the joys of flight. Thus,
say on a summer&#8217;s evening, the doors of the sheds will
be pushed aside, and the machines wheeled out and
overhauled; then, one by one, these small, fast-moving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
craft will rise into the air and dart here and
there&mdash;circling, man&#339;uvring, dipping, and diving.
So, one after another, either as pilots or passengers, will
the members of the club ascend; and before the sheds are
closed and the aerodrome deserted, each and all will
have soared in flight, and tasted that thrill and exultation
which comes of a rush in a plane through the cool of the
evening air. But to-day, if we try to grasp such a notion
as this, our state of mind is very like that of our
grandfathers had some prophet dared tell them the day
would dawn when, seated comfortably at dinner in a
car on wheels, men would be drawn by an engine at
60 miles an hour: and yet the man or woman who
has not, say twenty years hence, made a journey through
the air, will be in exactly the same position as one who,
at the present time, has never been by train.</p>

<p>We shall, with the coming of this air age,
have to alter our notions both of distance and of time. From
the air-stations which will girdle London, machines will
be leaving hourly upon non-stop flights. All over
England, in fact, towns and cities will be linked by air.
London and Manchester, for example, will be then connected
by a regular service, and the journey made in
less than two hours. Dotted across country, and following
the track of the main airways, will be a well-planned
chain of landing grounds; and here local passenger craft
will descend, and goods-carrying machines pause to set
down their burdens. The national air service, in all
details of its operation, will need to be well organised.
Towns which are upon the air routes will set aside tracts
of land, and upon these will be provided the facilities of
an air-station. From London to York; from London
to Chester; from London to Bristol; from London to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Portsmouth&mdash;thus, with their landing grounds en route,
will the airways radiate. And passing constantly along
these routes will be a volume of air-borne traffic&mdash;neat,
privately owned planes; large and speedy passenger
machines; multi-winged craft for the transport of goods;
and here and there, flying swiftly and high, some slim-built
war machine. Upon the land in the day-time, to
indicate the direction of the airways, will be signs which
may be read from high aloft; while at night, from signal
towers, will flash forth lights, differing in the frequency
and the colour of the beams they throw skyward, to
guide the airman on his path.</p>

<p class="space-below2">In this way, and in due time, will the air yield
its benefits and pleasures. It is towards this final conquest
that we toil to-day&mdash;braving dangers that are deadly,
overcoming difficulties that appear unsurmountable&mdash;ready
to sacrifice our money and machines, and even the
lives of men. And in the end, repaying us for our
perils and our sorrows, the fairest of victories will be
won. First Europe, and then the globe, will be linked
by flight, and nations so knit together that they will
grow to be next-door neighbours. This conquest of the
air will prove, ultimately, to be man&#8217;s greatest and most
glorious triumph. What railways have done for nations,
airways will do for the world.</p>

This chapter was written before the outbreak of
the great war, and was intended as a forecast of aerial warfare
say five or ten years hence. At the present time, seeing that
gun-carrying and bomb-dropping machines are still purely
experimental, it is as flying scouts, and not as instruments of
destruction, that aircraft are doing their vital work.</p></div>
